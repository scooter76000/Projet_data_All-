I wanted to check this out since I'm sort of checking out all the Mexican places I can. I went in today around 3pm. First off, the place is a little dirty; there was a stink bug crawling on the guy's back, in front of me. And no one did speak English but I didn't have a problem communicating since I could read what was on their menu. I just pointed them out and hablo un pequeño espanol. :) 

I ordered a tongue taco and I sat down to wait for my order; took pictures for yelp. When my order was up, I went to the back to the counter to pay. I gave exact change; the prices were totally what 'mom and pop' Mexican places charge. You can tell it's a place for the locals. 

When I got home opened everything up and took pictures. I did like the fresh cilantro and onions but the tongue was a little dry for my liking. The actual taco shell was really nice, almost a little fluffy and the sauce that came with it was hot; I liked it. 

I can only give this 3 stars because of what I've mentioned above but I am willing to give them a second chance; I might try their tamales tomorrow.",0,0,0,Sarah,509,865,252,146,43,3.41

It's the same delicious food from the creative minds of the Nude Food truck. They have just evolved to a brick-and-mortar shop in Little Italy Wilmington, Delaware. I haven't posted pictures of their juices because I wind up drinking it because it's so delicious, I forget to take a picture. I recently had their pineapple mint, which is amazing. Understandably their priority is this business not so much the truck, so as of right now, the Newark location for the truck has been put on hold. That was their home base for quite a while.

When going to food truck events,  I'm mostly disappointed in the selection of just fried greasy options. There is an organization called the Rolling Revolution, which is like a food truck union in Delaware that some food trucks belong to. But there's almost like a clique happening now, with the same food trucks going to the same events which I just don't even attend.

Hopefully this brick-and-mortar place will do well and I will make an effort to try to get up there but it's not as convenient as it once was at the truck.

I sat at the counter. I told the waitress it was my first time she went over almost the entire menu with me. When she asked for my drink order I just asked for water.

As I was waiting for my food, an older guy sat down next to me and some how we started chatting. He was a really nice guy. We talked about the food, we talked about life. 

I think because we were talking, I felt like my order got there pretty quickly. It was really good. The chicken was lightly seasoned and yummy. Although I wasn't too fond of what they called tzatziki sauce. It was too runny for tzatziki sauce. It didn't taste bad, it just got sort of messy toward the end of the gyro.

The place looks smaller out front than it actually is inside. It was quite busy with our reservations at 5:15. We were seated in the back. I saw a healthier option menu online, that we didn't receive at the restaurant until I mentioned it. Their portions are pretty large and apparently you can do something called a ""split"", where you can order two things with someone and each get a half an order. So you can taste two different things at the same time for a cheaper price.

I honestly was not too impressed. I ordered off their skinny menu spicy shrimp campi? It was pretty decent but very bland. I noticed with  everyone else's order, like the chicken parmesan, instead of adding spices or different ingredients, they just add cheese on everything. Who doesn't like cheese? It's just when I'm coming for Italian I want to actually taste the food. I'm not sure if this matters at all but the majority of the people that were there were older, so maybe it's a good bang for your buck with the amount of food you get and the price that you pay.

But I never really a hundred percent believe the reviews until I experience it.

I was at FireStone this afternoon for a retirement party. The parking lot is very small and for whatever reason there were at least five or six random spots blocked off with orange traffic cones. Inside the layout looks nice and it's an open concept design restaurant but they have a few maintenance issues. It looks kind of dirty and run down in some areas and if you go into the woman's bathroom, you feel like there is a sink hole in the floor in front of the sinks. And that paper towel dispenser doesn't come back up automatically like it should.

I shouldn't have to say based upon the picture of the menu of what we had, the salad was the best part. But it kind of was. The crab cake was very small compared to the brochet bun it was on and rather flavorless. Also the bun was just soaked in butter so I didn't even eat it. Everybody else got the large portion of french fries that came with it but I opted out of that. The ratio of fries versus actual crab meat was ridiculous. The fries took up more then half the plate on everybody's plate. I'm not looking for a filler.

Also I opted out of the desert but everybody said the cheesecake was just bland and they couldn't figure out if it was a brownie on the bottom or some weird crust. The waitresses served us but the portions were different sizes for random guests.

There were multiple times where I had to get up to check on the wait staff and the place was not that busy so I don't know if they were short-staffed or if there was a miscommunication within the kitchen but it was kind of obnoxious having to get up from my seat twice because what I asked for never came. It was literally a wine for someone at my table and a ginger ale for myself at two different occasions throughout the event. It wasn't like I was asking for extra this or something weird with that, it was literally beverages.

Looking into this restaurant it doesn't surprise me to find out that a hospitality group owns it as well as a couple other restaurants. A hospitality group is literally just like a conglomerate. And with things that get too big the quality fails and that's definitely happening within this place.

Their staff is nice and when I told them it was my first time there, they took time to make me aware of off their options for my burrito. Their ingredients are SUPER FRESH! I ordered the citrus braised pork burrito with honey jalapeno sauce. The pork was cooked very nice, easy to pull apart. It was really pretty when he (I think his name was Don) put it all together.

One thing I have to say though, is that, I was a little disappointed with my burrito. I was expecting a little more in the way of it actually being Mexican food. I feel like this place is more of a gourmet burrito place (I guess for an $8+ burrito I should of known).

Maybe I chose the wrong thing, but I asked their facebook page what should I try and they told me anything should be good.

Although, Harry's Savoy Grill is located on Naamans Road the parking lot has trees and bushes to act as a visual buffer from the traffic. There was a comment here about this restaurant being located near a strip mall. You ever think when they built this place the strip mall might not have been there? You can't control who your neighbors will be in 10+ years from now.  

There were 2 women standing behind the hostess podium as my mother and I walked inside. We checked our coats and were asked if we wanted a table or a booth; we choose booth. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, in a separate area yet still attached to the large main dining room. The decor was a little old for my style; there was wood every where and the tabletops were copper. Also they used yellow glassware for the water and their plates seemed old and out of date.

The waitress took our drink order and wished me a happy birthday. I'm glad they have good communication within the restaurant. Little stuff like that is important for your customers. 

For appetizers I ordered the calamari and my mom ordered the crab dip. I love calamari and I want to say, this was the best tasting calamari I've ever had (and it's even good the next day - toaster oven.) It was lightly fried not greasy and the calamari was so tender, it almost melted in my mouth. The only thing I didn't like was the tomato based sauce that came with it. I asked the waitress if they had any spicy sauce; she brought out some Sriracha mayo a couple minutes later. It was just okay, could have been hotter. My mom's crab dip was okay. She liked it more than I did.

I ordered the salmon dinner and my mom ordered one of their steaks. The salmon wasn't spectacular but the mushroom, potato puree it was sitting in was delicious.  My mom was not impressed with the steak or the asparagus, that came with it, for the price. 

While eating dinner a chef came out and schmoozed with some customers. That was around the same time my waitress became less attentive to our table and more attentive to theirs. I've never been in a restaurant where the chef comes to a customer's table to have mini taste test with them. Kind of cool. 

For dessert, I ordered the honey, pomegranate sorbet and salty caramel gelato. Wow. Both were really good. You could taste the individual flavors. I have never really liked gelato before but I guess I've never had high quality gelato. My mom ordered the crème brûlée, she loved it.

The waitress wasn't bad or anything. At one point she noticed I was out of water and said she would get me more but she never did. I think she was just being more attentive to some regulars. The manager Judy actually came over with the water pitcher and introduced herself. I spoke with her the other day, on the phone, when making the reservations. She was friendly. 

Oh and I want to say this place wants to make it a dining experience. The wait staff had its timing down. There was never any rush. Before they brought out dessert there was almost like a ""resting period"" so you could digest a little bit. It was nice.
 
For 2 people the bill was around $110; but because it was my birthday they waved the desserts, so it was around $95. I can't see myself eating here weekly or anything but I will most likely return.


Pros: Relaxed atmosphere, good communication within the staff, best calamari I have ever had and amazing desserts.

The hostess checked her papers of prepaid tickets and found us. Our next step was to walk over to the catering food trays. I had seen pictures of the place online so I knew the setup, which helped. I wish the hostess would have welcomed us a little more by directing us to the different areas. I only mention that because the space is not set up like a ""typical"" restaurant; it has more of an event hall ""open space"" feel. It was just our first time here and I would have just appreciated, ""Hi, have you been here before? No? Oh well, there is food set up over there *points* and just a heads up, all the tables are reserved but there is plenty of room at the bar."" Because what happened was that we got our food and just walked around holding our plates looking for a place to sit. All the tables seemed to be reserved so we sat at the bar; which was totally fine.

We tried pretty much all the food presented. I am not usually a fried food person but the fish was lightly battered, moist and yummy. We had some jerk chicken, that was a little bland compared to other times I have had it from different places. The meatballs (I can't remember how they were prepared) but the flavor was kind of off putting with the other food items presented; we didn't finish them. Also, I didn't see any ""sweets"" that were mentioned on the ticket page.

The bar was a nice place to sit; plenty of room and a great spot for watching the TVs or the dance floor. 

The chef was welcoming; he walked around to check on how guests were doing. It was nice to see that; its rare at most restaurants. You could tell he actually cared. Also, the bartenders were attentive, accommodating and friendly. 

Also, a big plus, is the size of their dance floor. Delaware has lacked a good restaurant/bar/dance place for years. It could be a generational gap and maybe younger people are not going out dancing.

This was a fun, laid back environment with like minded folks who just want to eat good food and have a chill time. We will be back (planning on going for the Superbowl; although I don't see any even happening yet.) I do wish their website and social media were up-to-date.

The place seemed clean and for there being so many people it wasn't that loud. I think the wood, which was everywhere, isolated the sound or something. The waitress seemed very rushed and didn't seem too interested in my table. I mean our needs were met but defiantly just a 10% tip; I always tip more for better service.

My meal, the salmon just tasted like salmon; even though it said it was marinated in pineapple and soy sauce but I didn't taste any of that. The veggies were still crunchy; I liked my steamed more. The mashed potatoes were great though; skins still in it. Since I checked in on yelp I got their 'free dessert' offer; I ordered their chocolate cheesecake (which wasn't that great, there were 2 colors and one looked like it should have tasted like peanut butter but sadly, it did not.)

Overall it was just sort of a blah experience. I don't know if I'd go back, maybe if I am in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Nothing special there.",1,0,0,Sarah,509,865,252,146,43,3.41

Like another reviewer stated, they cook the burger the way you ask; I asked for med. rare and that's exactly what I got (picture uploaded.) The bun was nice, it wasn't that large burger bun (like more bread than meat.) There was a nice char on the burger. The fries weren't that good, they were soggy by the time I got home, wish they could find a way to keep them crunchy for take-out orders.

Well, finally we were able to go for brunch on Sunday.

First, look at my ratings I don't give out fives lightly but the food here was delicious and on point. The decor is country chic, refurbished wood, hipster, young parent but still likes to drink clientele. 

The place was large inside lots of wood, the bar was right next to the front door on the right when you walked in. We sat at a table against the wall. I ordered there Austin Benedict and my friend ordered I can't remember the name, but it was basically a little bit of everything. And I ordered some scrapple fries to share. I asked about them and basically it's just a nice thick piece of Rapa scrapple cut in 3 pieces lengthwise with some maple syrup dipping sauce. It was good. And a syrup was still light but flavorful.

My Austin Benedict was delicious and what eggs benedict is supposed to be. I recently had that dish for the first time at a restaurant in Rehoboth and it was awful. The Goat had layers of flavor in this thing. You could taste the biscuit which had flavor, you could obviously taste the ham, the poached egg on top was the most perfect poached egg I have had in my life. When I cut my fork through it, it oozed delicious yolky goodness all over the biscuit. I'm not a big yoke eater but this was just so good. Also the side was sweet potato home fries, which reminded me of Thanksgiving roasted vegetables. Yum!

On the other hand, my friend was not satisfied with his meal it seemed. He really doesn't like sweet potatoes and it didn't say that on the menu and the waitress didn't notify him. She just asked him if he wanted Rye or white toast with his meal. So I think he was kind of bummed out about that. I told him he could say something but he just didn't speak up. Also what added to his experience was he had to ask the waitress twice for ketchup because she had forgotten it.

I don't want to say they do seem to push alcohol but after we ordered our meals, we were given their alcohol menu and told about their specials. And I get that is standard but if your liquor menu is lengthier than your food menu....meh. Mostly because this place is kind of in the middle of nowhere so statistically you know people are driving home drunk from this place.

I digress, the waitress did tell me that they basically have a different menu every night and I wish I absorbed all the other good stuff that she told me about the place. When we sat down I had informed her it was our first time there. It's just farther than I would normally travel to be a regular somewhere.

I was in the mood for something more breakfast like.

When you park in the lot you will notice there are 2 signs and 2 doors; park in the lot (by the sign facing rt. 4) and go around to the main door. As soon as I walked inside I liked the atmosphere. It didn't have that typical ""bar"" feeling. I'm not really a drinker but I liked the old style beer cans on the wall, the cool different taps as you walk in, all the glasses behind the bar and everything was made of wood. The thing is, they have another dining area, but it's back behind the main dining area which seems to be . I wish this place had a better flow. The waitress (I'm sorry I forget her name) was nice. I told her it was my first time  there.

My mom ordered the South Philly Omelette (which she liked) and the Mary Mary Quite Contrary Bloody Mary. I had a taste of the Bloody Mary and it was pretty good. The alcohol wasn't overpowering and it was spicy.

I ordered the Sunday Smokehouse. You could taste the smoke in all the meats. The brisket was really good; falling apart with a fork tender. The pulled pork was so good and I know what I'm going to order the next time I go in. The chipotle pork belly, I didn't taste the chipotle as much as I would have liked, the smoke seemed to overpower it. 

What I noticed also was some of the owners were there serving people. I don't know if that's typical since this was my first time but it was nice. Ben came over to wrap up my leftovers and I introduced myself to him, telling him how I found out about them. 

If it wasn't for the yelp reviews, honestly I'm not even sure I would have given this place a second look.

The scrambled eggs were fluffy, the home fries were good, the biscuit had some cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on it, the scrapple was a nice thick cut and had a nice crisp outer layer.

I really wanted to like this place. Before going in, I contacted them on facebook, to ask the a few question (parking and such) and they were helpful; some restaurants don't realize the importance of social media. 

I parked in a parking garage where they validate. The layout of Deep Blue is very disjointed. There is the main dining area to the right, which was just a room with a lot of tables. When you walk inside there is a small hostess podium to the right. The room you are in is large and has the bar in the middle of the room and the kitchen behind that. The space is not utilized that well. I was seated by a woman behind the bar; I think her name was Julia. She was polite and friendly. 

First course; Hearts of Romaine - Crispy hearts of romaine, classic Caesar dressing, croutons. They forgot the dressing and I didn't even ask for it. The salad tasted fine without it because there was shredded cheese topping it. The croutons just tasted like plain white bread so I didn't eat the rest. 

Second course; Soft Shell Crab Sandwich - Tempura battered, lettuce, tomato, zesty caper, remoulade, sweet potato fries. This was my first soft shell crab. I don't know. It needed more sauce because the bread that it was served on, soaked it up and there was no spice on the crab. And the crab, I don't know. I love blue crab in the summer; steamed. The texture was fine, it was just the taste, some bites were good and other were not. Also the sweet potato fries were squishy and it would have been nice if they offered a different sauce for them besides ketchup.

When I went to the hostess to have my parking garage ticket validated; she said, ""You're fabulous."" And I looked at her and asked her why and she said, ""That's your validation."" Goofy.

I want to make note that the pictures you see in this yelp listing, from Mary D. in 2011, their grand opening, they do not look that nice now. It's not run down, but the ginger and wasabi were in the corner of a buffet table, not on ice, like the picture. Also her pictures of how they lay out the sushi, is not how they do it now; very barren. 

This place is rather large when you walk in and turn to the left. There was a little take-out register and a podium that had a ""wait to be seated"" sign. We were promptly seated. 

The buffet area was probably the largest buffet I had ever been to; I think there were about 8 or 9 different buffet sections with various food. They had pig's feet, frog legs, general Tso's chicken, half crabs, crayfish, cooked noodle dishes, mac and cheese, egg rolls, random stuff. I only tasted different types of sushi, since my co-worked raved about it. The chef does not cut the rolls all the way through so when you grab a piece, with the tongs, you bring the entire roll with you. I filled my plate with different rolls and sat down. The crunchy shrimp wasn't that bad. There were a few others, can't remember what they were, that were so awful, I actually had to spit out in my napkin. Seriously. The eel tasted bad, like overpowering bad. The rice was super sticky because, it is a buffet so who knows how long the food had been out.

I needed to cleanse my palette with some dessert. Something that annoyed me, none of the desserts, were labeled. So it was like a lucky pick of the draw getting something you liked. Wasn't impressed by any of the 6 things I tried and didn't finish any of them. I can see this place wasting a LOT of food. 

There were staff, these ladies, who would stand against the wall watching everyone. When you got up to get another plate of food, they would remove your used plate.

When we got the check, they gave us fortune cookies. I don't really like them and I think most people just open them to get the fortune. This is not a Japanese place but a generic Asian restaurant.  

This Hibachi shares a parking lot with a grocery store, an A.C. Moore and a Kohl's, it was packed and hard to find a spot at 6PM.

I guess the incentive for people to come here, is that the buffet is $13 something. But I believe in, you pay for what you get sometimes, so I will pay a little more for better quality. I will not return here for the sushi. The best place I've tried in Delaware for sushi is Sushi Sumo; it's further west on Kirkwood Highway, headed towards Newark. Clean, friendly, intimate atmosphere. Plus, when you get your check, they give you these little Japanese candies; melon or banana. Yum.

As you can see from my first review, I gave feedback from my perspective about the festival. And when I communicated with their social media person last year, everything was fine and they even thanked me for adding their event to yelp.

Well this year, I contacted the festival in April via their facebook, to ask about the 2017 release date. I was told they were working on things and to check back later. Well, when they came out with this year's event date, it was 2 months after their original June ETA. And this year, it falls on the same date as the Delaware Burger Bash and I have attended that that for years because the money goes to charity. When I mentioned that, in a comment on the Taco Festival's facebook I was removed and then blocked from the page. 

So needless to say, I will not be returning to this event. And from their recent post (screenshot included in pictures for this listing) their targeted demographic is quite clear. This event could have been so good and I was willing to wait until they ironed out the wrinkles but it's just a generic event to get money from young white people who drink. Everything (advertising) seems to be tailored to them. I like culture, different foods and people who look different, speak different languages than I do...it gives me a chance to experience something new and learn about others. Sorry, I'm over the generic ""college aged"" white people, who all look the same in their rompers, mom jeans from the 90's and this 'new' tread of 50's style glasses frames with aviator reflective lenses who drink to feel something because they are boring people.",2,0,1,Sarah,509,865,252,146,43,3.41

There were 5000 tickets that were sold, so you would think it was safe to assume the Premier Events, INC would have things handled. We got there around 2pm and the line was already 75+ people deep. As we were standing in line, in the parking lot, in the hot sun, the line barely moved. There were two lines, one for phone tickets and one for printed. We were in line for at least 25 minutes. An event staff guy was making his way down the line, checking ids and giving out ""age verified"", neon yellow, wrist bands. 

As my friend and I finally got to the gates, where they were scanning tickets, another event guy saw how long the line was and tried to expedite getting people inside. He asked for people's tickets and was trying to just let people in and another event worker, with the scanner, told him to hold up because she needed to scan all the tickets. I've seen at other events how the scanners sometimes, get overloaded, and run slower so maybe they were having an issue with that.

Once we were passed the gates we were given our drink/taco vouchers. On the website site, it said with purchase of a ticket, you would get a free shot glass, apparently that was not factual because they didn't have anymore.

We walked into the stadium to check out where everything was because there was no map of where each vendor was located.  There were some vendors inside the stadium but we really didn't check those out. 

We walked outside behind the stadium where all the tents were. There was tall fencing around the area  so people couldn't sneak in but it was a pain walking back, because you had to walk back to the front of the stadium only to walk back, on the other side of the fencing, to get back to your car.

There were a bunch of taco vendors (I think they said it was 30) in this large parking lot. We tried a couple different restaurants. I was surprised that there weren't any taco food truck vendors there. There are several taco trucks around Delaware that are delicious. The lines weren't too long but it was so freaking hot. There was hardly any shade and there were no cooling tents or anything. There were a couple ice cream/water ice vendors. There was a tequila tasting area in the middle of the parking lot and bottled water available in other areas of the lot.

They had a hot pepper eating contest and a mariachi band. 

I do wish they had other protein options than chicken, pork or beef. Maybe a shrimp or seafood taco. 

As we walked to our cars, we saw the event staff hanging out shot glasses. I mentioned to one of the staff, that we never got ours, and we were given two. I was disappointed because they were just generic plastic Jose Cuervo one. I was hoping it would have had ""Delaware Taco Festival"" on it or something.

I liked the layout of the place, 2 different rooms, yet they were still connected. I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar or at a table; I always pick a table. I'm short and I don't like ""hopping"" up in the bar chairs/stools; plus I don't drink anyhow. 

The hostess seemed to have been in a poor mood. She wasn't rude but, I don't know, a little pissy? I was seated and I took some pictures for yelp. I already knew what I wanted to order, since they had a ""restaurant week"" website. 

For my 1st course, I ordered, a spring salad; arugula, feta, strawberries, candied pecans, maple-walnut vinaigrette. It was pretty darn good. I uploaded a picture. The bread stick that came with it, was sort of pointless to me. It didn't do anything to add to the dish; not much flavor and the texture was just squishy. 

For my 2nd course, I ordered, their Moroccan flat bread; roasted figs, goat cheese, caramelized onions, toasted pine nuts, pesto-basil infused olive oil, balsamic reduction. If this had a nice, thin, dip it would have been awesome. It needed a dip also because the flat bread was dry, I couldn't finish a piece (left the back part that was just bread); it would be been nice to be able to dip that piece in something and eat it. The figs were small and didn't have much flavor; but I'm not sure it's even fig season. The flavors did blend together, just like the salad.

This location is on Limestone Road (rt. 7) between Kirkwood highway and Stanton Middle School. 

They have a decent size parking lot. Inside, I would describe the design as modern (reminded me a little of Mikimotos in downtown Wilmington); lots of different lighting. We sat at the sushi bar which had an almost obnoxious blue light in your face, along the entire bar (I posted a picture.) There were these cool glass beads on cords, that hung from the ceiling, that looked like water. And I have to say, I did like the instrumental music playing; relaxing. The place was clean as well.

As far as the staff, there were a bunch of employees; 2 hostesses, at least 5 waiters/waitresses, 4 sushi chefs, maybe a couple managers and the owner, whom I met, Lyn (I don't know if that is the correct spelling). Everyone was polite and accommodating. Dan was our waiter and I have to say, he was a little too attentive at times. When we sat down he said something about us being two beautiful ladies or something along those lines; and I just felt like he might be fishing for a higher tip. We got our drinks and appetizers, then our food (all in a timely manner) but he kept asking us how everything was; even before we had even taken our first bite of anything. Even one of the sushi chefs asked (once) how everything was before I had tasted any of the sushi rolls. I made it a point to let Dan know it was our first time eating there. I asked if the restaurant was locally owned. He pointed out the owner Lyn and introduced us. She was a nice woman, talking about her restaurant in Dover and that it was a family owned business (her parents were in the back cooking.) She said they have only been open for about 5 months; and haven't invested too much into advertising, mostly just word of mouth. I remember seeing an article in The News Journal about this place a few months back.

Now onto my meal: I ordered green tea and what was nice was they served, not just a cup full of tea but a small little pot with hot water and a few jasmine green tea bags; it was good.

For the appetizer I ordered their, Tropical salad: Carrots, cucumber, peanut, mango, shrimp, tako, crunch with pineapple sauce. It was large but I was really disappointed. All I tasted was pineapple sauce; literally. For as many goodies inside I really wanted to taste all the individual favors. I couldn't find any shrimp or peanuts in it and the most flavorful things were the croutons.

I ordered 3 rolls: Firework: Shrimp tempura, mango, & avocado inside, wrapped soy paper, spicy tuna & crunch, masago on top with spicy house special sauces.

Undersea Roll: Salmon, avocado, shrimp, crab meat & masago, wrapped with soy bean paper and chef's special sauce.

Coastal Roll: Spicy salmon, crunch, avocado inside, scallop, sliced lime and masago on top.

The rolls were large, like stuff into your mouth large, but the flavor, the freshness, just wasn't there. I was disappointed again. Now, I've had my fair share of sushi (check out my other reviews from around Delaware) and by far my favorite is still Tree Garden. I like a place that puts more money into quality ingredients and less on the ambiance. I guess you can have both but I haven't found a place that has had that balance.

I also had a bite of my friend's crab rangoon and I didn't taste any crab. The cheese was off-putting. They were cut into triangles and not the little dumpling style that I like.

All-in-all the food here, was like ""white people sushi""...as in just mediocre. Another reason that makes me say that, besides the taste, is that listed on the menu for multiple items they state ""crunch"" and not ""tempura flakes"". Like they had to make their menu ""white people friendly"".

I might try it again (if someone else paid) because I believe in second chances. But for an $80+ check, I was just was hoping for more. I would have given this place a 2 star if I was just rating the food though.",0,0,1,Sarah,509,865,252,146,43,3.41

I ordered their surf and turf burrito and their agua de fresa strawberry guava. Even having to eat it after the drive home it was still amazing. I love that they cut their burritos in half. Perfect little size sauces. The red is no joke bring the heat and there is cilantro in their cooler verde. Also the drink strawberry guava was a perfect balance with the heat.

The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I've eaten a lot of food Mexican trucks and I think this place ruined me for all of them. This meal was so delicious I can't wait to try their other items.

I had called in my order. I waited in line a little bit for the ladies in front of me to order. The woman working the window was patient, she explained things to them,  and was professional.

If I wanted that I would go to Taco Bell.

This place is not that close to me but I have spread the word to my friend who lives in the area and I will be making more of an effort to get out that way. This truck knows what it's doing and you can taste the love and experience in the food.

Their torta is the best torta I have ever had from any Mexican place in the tri-state area. That is usually my 'to-go' option. But as I have been eating here, I have been exploring other options on the menu I know wouldn't hold up via take-out or delivery.

I ordered one today and they changed it and there are just sad jalapenos and it lost it's flavor.

Oh and heads up, I think the owner is an overweight guy, who is usually sitting in the dining area barking orders at the female waitresses. He also likes to change his prices all the time even if the menu states something different. Like I ordered a piece of flan (btw don't. It's bland. If you want good flan, go to Juliana's Kitchen in Wilmington, DE) and the waitress told me it was $2. When she came out of the kitchen with it, the overweight guy asked her how much she was selling it to me for and he told her to charge me $5 because it was made ""in house."" If it was made in house shouldn't it be cheaper than him having to bring it in from another maker? Hablo un poco español.

The owner reminds me of a guy you would see on Chris Hansen's ""To Catch a Predator"" or maybe an undercover 20/20 story of a guy smuggling in something. They way he just sits there and everyone is working around him.

I don't know but I think I might be done with this place.

Our waiter was really nice; checked on us when he should and left us alone when he should. Pushy or inattentive waiters are annoying. I asked him what was popular for the burgers and he said the Brewhouse so I ordered it.

I was a little disappointed with my burger. I asked for it to be cooked med (which to me means a little pink) there was no pink and it was flat, almost like a fast food burger. The bun was good, I think it was like a buttery bun. 

Their onion ring batter is different than any other onion ring I've tasted. It was almost like cakey in a way; moist even though the onion ring was crunchy on the outside; a bit greasy though.

We just had wings from here the other day and they are big too; tender but with that right crunch on the outside. I have to say though, the Thai Ginger is sweet and in my opinion could use some grated fresh ginger for balance. My mom loves their BBQ wings and their salads are on point. You can taste the freshness of their ingredients. That is so important today because people eat too much generic crap. And I'll post some better pictures in the future.

I didn't really think anything of it since I had never heard of them before. But today, a friend and I were going to go to Tierra Cali for some dinner, but as we were about parking, I saw Tropical Smoothie Cafe on the other side of the shopping center. Not really knowing what they had (or if they had food options), we decided to park and check them out. And I'm so glad we did because we will be back.

So, this location is in the Pike Creek Shopping center on the side where the Applebee's is located; in-between Jade's Nails and the flower shop. There are pictures of wraps and other food on their windows so at this point, we knew they had food. They have long hours too, from like 7am to 9pm most days except Sundays. When you walk inside there is plenty of seating as you walk in to the left and along the wall to the right. It was like a contemporary casual, almost country style with the distressed metal chairs and wooden floors.

We went up to the counter (we were the only customers at that time, I think like 7:15pm maybe) and looked over their menu. The staff were right there, behind the counter waiting for us to choose an option. I ordered their chicken chipotle flatbread and my friend, I can't remember, but got a wrap and it had rice in it.

We took a seat. Also, when you order a wrap or a sandwich, you get to choose a side. Their selection is awesome from oranges and bananas to different kinds of ""healthy"" chips. I really liked that fruit was an option. I thought they would call us up when our order was ready, but nope, an employee actually brought it to our table, in little portion sized metal plates. That was kind of nice and not expected. 

My flatbread was delicious. The chicken was moist and all around tasty. I'm not usually a flatbread type of person but it was yummy and the chipotle mayo was a nice kick. My friend's wrap was kind of small but maybe because you were able to get a side with it. He liked it, but he liked my flatbread more. I can't wait to try out other items. Also, as my friend and I were eating, I told him we apparently came in at a good time, because the place was pretty busy as we were finishing up our meal.

Okay, now for the staff. They were great! I made a point to meet the owner Jimit Modi after we ate. He was delightful with me but also with his staff. He seemed to be a good mentor with helping to train his staff and making it a fun environment for them as well. He shared with me his first job was basically the same as his staff so I could see he understood about teaching them responsibility. 

This place is great and the area needed healthier options. Oh I didn't mention this, but I don't really buy smoothies since I make them at home. But this place does it right with REAL fruit and not some liquid concoction in a blender. One day, I will try one of their combos that apparently comes with a smoothie. Plus, they have different boosts you can put in it (like powders and what not.)

The reasons that I could not give them 5 stars; they use non-biodegradable Styrofoam for all their smoothies. That adds up to a lot of trash in our landfills. And they don't seem to use organic ingredients. This place has it right with so many things, but I would be willing to pay an extra 10 cents for organic fruits and veggies. That's why I make my own.

Although the location in the shopping center is not the greatest.

I eat sushi a couple times a month (sometimes more) and I have eaten sushi in at least 10 different restaurants around the area. I found Chaiyo a little more than a month ago from Yelp. I have eaten there 3 times and the last time was for their grand opening event. The manager and co-owner Mike, I guess is the front man and the other co-owner(s) are preparing the food. I think he said this was their 3rd location, the others are around Dover.

Whenever I have sushi, I sit at the sushi bar. Chaiyo does it right. They do little things that some other restaurants miss. Chaiyo offers a hot towel  before your meal AND the sushi chefs provide a little free sushi yummy. Also, there have a bunch of deals; if your order 2 or more specialty rolls, you get soup and salad. The miso soup is always good and their salad is the typical lettuce salad you would get from a sushi restaurant. 

I've only tried about 5 or 6 of their rolls and already have my favorite. The service is always good and I appreciate the waitresses asking if I want lemon with my water. I'm not a fan of lemon but most places just assume you want it. It would be nice if places started offering an orange or lime slice. 

Chaiyo is in my top 5 favorite sushi restaurants in the area for the reasons I have listed above, but also, and the most important, the sushi yummy and chilled! Too many sushi chefs leave the door open to the fish making the temperature inside lower. By the time you get your order, the fish is room temperature and the rolls fall apart between your chopsticks. Tragic.

My mother and I decided to get dinner around 5pm. This was our first time here and I notified the staff and our waitress. Sometimes when you let a restaurant know it's your first time, they go over things with you more comprehensively and want to make your experience a positive one. We were seated in the main dining area, with no other customers; but there were several loud customers at the bar.

Our waitress was named Britney, with blonde hair. She never told us about the specials, like I heard other waiters do when taking their customers' order. I mean it was our first time, you'd think she would have explained their specials of the night. My mom ordered the stuffed mushrooms and I had their house salad. She liked her mushrooms. I didn't really like the salad dressing, there was too much vinegar. The different flavors threw me off. 

This was the best part, so this place has different staff doing different things. Like the waitress doesn't bring you your food, someone else does and there are guys around refilling your water. Well when we got our food, the waitress comes over almost immediately and asks, ""How does everything look?"" How does it look? She should have waited a couple minutes and just asked how everything was. Who asks how something looks? I care about the taste. She wasn't really attentive and I had to search for her a couple times. It's not like they were busy, at all either.

My mom ordered the crab cake and I ordered their turkey avocado sandwich. The crab cake was bland and came with this off putting aioli sauce. My sandwich was huge. I tried taking small bites but I would just get some turkey or a piece of tomato. In order to get the flavor of all the ingredients I had to shove my face into the sandwich, leaving my face a complete mess. It was ridiculous. I'm not even sure how good it was since I was trying to just get one bite with everything. Also, the avocado wasn't ripe and just kept popping out of the sandwich. The chips that came with them were oily and I did not eat the rest. The best thing on the plate, almost, was the pickle.

After our experience there is nothing that makes me want to come back to this place. The only reason I didn't give it a 2 star rating is because it was clean and well decorated.

I came in recently to pick up the DSK deluxe burger and vanilla milkshake. When I walked in there was no acknowledgement even though I was literally the only customer. I stood there while the owner berated one of the staff. Apparently, my food had already been made and I was just standing there for no reason. Because I saw the closed bag with my name on it behind the counter. Meanwhile an Uber Eats driver comes in and he is acknowledge, pays for his meal and leaves. Finally I'm acknowledged and paid for my food. I was given my shake but still had to wait around even though the bag was still there.  So I'm not sure what the issue was.

And as the previous review states I think this place gets a lot of attention just because there's not a lot of vegan/vegetarian options in the area. But I don't think they really care about customer service. When you have a product that nobody else is offering sadly you don't really have to.

I don't live anywhere close to the area but I specifically came to support businesses at this time. Well the burger was good at the beginning but I didn't finish the rest of it and apparently had a really bad bout of indigestion. Which I don't typically experience from vegan food.

Today, I pre-ordered but had to call in to push it back a couple hours; they were cool with it because I gave them plenty of time. I go in to pick it up and I let them know about the burrito issue (showed employee the picture) and she told me she could remake it; but my order was already so large I didn't want a burrito right now. 

I wish people would wear name tags or something to help with accountability. Talked to the manager and she seemed confused even after I had already told her the same story I told the previous employee. She first asked if I had a receipt? What? No, I don't have a burrito receipt from a week ago. But here is the thing, I have an account with this store because I order online. I told her that she could look it up, it is under my account. If you are the manager wouldn't you know that? She then tells me that ""sometimes when the burritos sit around for a while they get wet."" So, what my order sitting around? Look, the issue is that they don't use refried beans they use whole beans; and when they scoop the black beans it comes with black bean juice. Refried beans are almost like glue in a burrito holding everything together; Tierra Cali does not have that and so that's why everything falls out; but also there was very very little chicken which isn't usually typical again until recently.

So, I don't know if they are training new people or what the issue has been but I know as a customer I am not having the greatest experience....also, the guac is just not good anymore. I don't know what they changed but I have ordered it twice over the last month and there is some weird taste that I will never order it again. 

This is a smaller business and with all the other franchise type places popping up around the area I understand the importance of supporting the smaller one. But also, as a customer you don't want to feel like you are wasting money. And the kicker is I always tip, usually generously so the fact that I was given a $1 refund over the food and just the extra time I didn't need to spend in that place if maybe their employees' had better communication? Yet what did I do with that dollar and the coins? Put it right in their tip bucket.

It really wasn't about the money, it was to give them a heads up about the situation. Maybe I will stop in for chips and queso but sadly that is the only thing that has been consistent. There are Mexican food trucks in the area with reliably good food.",0,0,0,Sarah,509,865,252,146,43,3.41

I arranged my day to be able to stop here for lunch. I didn't have a problem finding the place because I planned a visit so I did my reconnaissance.

I arrived before a few other customers so I had time to check out the menu and do a little chit chatting with the ladies working. I told them it was my first time and I was welcomed; good vibes.

I ordered a cheeseburger with mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickles (which are homemade) and I wanted to try their sauce; fetch, dragon breath, nightmare and awesome sauce. And 2 of these amazing looking strawberry lemonades they make. Also, since I was traveling a bit the girl (sorry I didn't get her name) suggested a deconstructed burger. Points for this food truck #1 knowing what that is and #2 properly executing it. They use recyclable containers!!

I don't know if I should mention this because we are in this in-between time of the next bout of COVID; I was wearing my mask because I do everywhere. I want to respect others and this is kinda the way to do it. The staff didn't have masks but I think I saw something on their facebook that stated his employees were vaxed. https://www.facebook.com/mike.stanley.184/videos/3942975009150370

Fast forward: When I got home everything was perfect! And look at my reviews...I do not use the ""p"" word when reviewing places but my order was. Also, look at the little :) on the wrappers! Little touches like this make smiles and I am all about that.

All the ingredients were fresh (look at those pictures) this is an upgrade to the classic American burger. The meat was tasty and I appreciate they don't go heavy on the salt like some smash burger places. I like to taste the meat, not the salt. Their pickles...omg...I am so ordering a whole pickle next time I visit. Also,  I can't believe the amount of free ingredients they offer. 

I really enjoyed their awesome sauce, while creamy and smooth it has a nice little bite from the horseradish. I'm all about the bite. Also, I liked the dragon breath, it had a good balance of heat and sweet. The fetch was a little too sweet alone and the nightmare kinda reminded me of a version of Franks's RedHot.

The strawberry lemonade was delicious! It was not over sugary at all! I wish I could get a gallon of it...perfect pairing with the burger...love seeing the strawberry seeds....fresh!

Oh I almost forgot to mention, the girl who took my order, was mindful to ask about nut allergies; apparently their nightmare sauce has toasted almonds. I don't have allergies but I appreciate a business who looks out for their customers like that. Very nicely done. 

If I could give them an extra star I would...they were out there in this metal truck, in an asphalt parking lot, in the middle of a 95+ degree sunny day...I tipped extra as we all should at times like this.

I ordered the tuna burger with a side of butternut squash and my friend ordered the shrimp po' boy. My burger was very bland; the only thing that had favor was the tiny bit of sauce that was on it. Also, the squash was really small for a side.

You can read my ratings of Harry's Savoy Grill (http://www.yelp.com/biz/harrys-savoy-grill-wilmington#hrid:ejCqKnGZr1ySPmKuiXSdlw) to see why I say that.

This was my first time at the Seafood Grill. I had been given a $50 gift card from Judy, a manager at their Savoy Grill (read my review - http://www.yelp.com/biz/harrys-savoy-grill-wilmington#hrid:2AVxP71BC7i-3MQeRSFxaA - and you will know why.) 

This is a pretty location, on the Riverfront in Wilmington, Delaware. It's attached to the Riverfront Market. 

I overheard our waitress, Jennifer D., saying to another customer that she had been working there for about 2 years. I would have expected something better then.

I uploaded a bunch of pictures. I ordered their calamari for an appetizer; it had fried jalapenos in it. Also the aioli was better than Harry's Savoy has to offer (they have some sweet tomato one that doesn't go well.)

For my entree I ordered their grilled chicken breast, mostly because none of their seafood looked appealing (since it's still early in the season.) But also I wanted to try their sriracha mashed potatoes which was $5 as a side. The chicken came with the potatoes, ""sugar snap peas and a sweet soy and ginger corn sauce."" First off, I've cooked with sriracha and the mashed potatoes just tasted like a 5 year old squirted a sriracha bottle into the potatoes. I've also cooked with soy sauce and ginger and the corn was just gross. And I wasn't going to pay $22.95 just for a chicken breast. 

I do not like to send food back to the kitchen but this was a meal I was not going to force myself to eat (after the last meal I had at Harry's Savoy Grill.) So, I had to send it back. My waitress, Jennifer D. didn't even ask me what was wrong with it. I would have told her the list of things that was wrong with that dish. She took my plate and brought me out a menu. Then I see her go to her manager, I think his name was Jerry (he was a little guy with a suit) and I read her lips from across the restaurant. She was basically mocking me and since Jerry wasn't facing me, I could just read his body language and he seemed not to really care and was enabling the waitress to run her mouth. Also, there were couple regulars behind my table and Jennifer D. had no problem doting on them. Yet she did not do that for my table. She was not attentive and would walk by several times without even looking at me or my guest.  

After looking at the menu, again, I ordered their soft shell crab. And this time the manager Jerry, brought it to my table with a grin on his face and he apologized but again, no one ever asked what was wrong with the chicken dish. The crab, the little salad and sauce on the crab was great. 

My guest and I ordered dessert. I ordered the rhubarb berry upside cake and it wasn't good either. I had about 2 bites and didn't even finish it. My guest did not really like her meal either (not for Harry's prices.) She ordered their slow braised short rib with a raspberry chipotle BBQ, honey cumin sweet potato fries, with a buttered pickle and red cabbage slow. I had some of it and the rib was okay but the rest of it was sort of a mess.

There were a few times where my guest and I were just sitting waiting for Jennifer D. to come back to our table. It was funny when she finally brought me the check she elevated her tone and tried to be chipper as she handed it to me, trying to get that tip. 

The check was $108 so with the $50 gift card I paid $58.75 out of pocket and even that was too much for the quality of food that my guest and I received today.  And I tipped less than 10% because of everything I listed above. When I get good service I tip 15-25% so for me to tip so low is something I don't like doing. But I believe a tip is earned.

I wrote on the back of the receipt, a little note telling Jennifer D. why I tipped so low; that I saw her mocking me to her manager and how she should treat all customers the same and not be so ""snooty"" to new customers. Because new customers are potential return customers. There were a lot of older people there and maybe their taste buds aren't as sharp anymore or maybe people are getting drunk and can't taste as well. Because I don't understand why these restaurants need to add unnecessary ingredients to their food. These dishes came out as a mangled mess not a culinary symphony. Simple is best and let the quality of food speak for itself.

It seems like regulars get more attention and maybe get better food. This is just my experience but because of it, there is no way I can give that amount of money to restaurants who are so hit or miss and clearly do not care about my business.",4,0,0,Sarah,509,865,252,146,43,3.41

But there was nothing about this place that I couldn't find better right down the road. After following this restaurant on social media, after repeated monthly push backs of their opening date, my mom and I tried this place for the first time yesterday for lunch. Parking is not an issue since this location is in a shopping center with a large parking lot. There was a guy out front in all black smoking and as he was walking in we were behind him it just reeked of cigarette smoke. Not really the first thing you want to smell going into a restaurant. The place looks modern with its metal pipes on the wall and it does have a TV behind the sushi bar; but thankfully the sound was muted. When I go out to sushi, I sit at the sushi bar for a variety of reasons, none which I received here. No, hot towel, no free sushi yummy, and the wait staff was not attentive at all as I will further explain.

We ordered water with our meal and the cool thing they did was bring out a full pitcher (not the typical no lid pitchers) and 2 metal cups filled with ice water. I was disappointed there was lemon in my water as I am not a fan but some restaurants automatically assume that you want it. It wasn't on the side of the cup, it was in it. I wasn't going to say anything because I don't know, we just got there. I just removed it. The waitress started to hand us wrapped straws but I told her no thank you. We just go into autopilot with plastic in the US. I didn't go onto lecture her but I will say here, there are too many straws that are non-biodegradable in the world. Go to youtube and look up sea turtles and plastic straws and hopefully you will understand. 

For our meal, my mom ordered a bento box, a mango/avocado roll and I ordered two of their specifically rolls; dragon and pink lady. It was hard to find something on their menu if you just wanted salmon with no tuna. When eating sushi as much as I do, I try to be mindful of the over-fishing of species. This is a great website, if you don't already know about it; http://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-recommendations/sushi.  

The unique thing about their sushi bar is that it sits up a little higher than some other restaurants and you get a good view of the chefs making sushi. And they had the standard multi-color changing lights.

Our sushi was made before my mom's bento box came out, maybe a timing issue with the wait staff and kitchen? They were just going to have our sushi, which was literally within eating distance from my face, sit there for how long before my mom's bento box came out? I looked around for our waitress because that is usually the protocol, that the house staff gives you your food, not the sushi chef. But she was looking at something with the guy in all black. BTW, if he wasn't the manager, he was the owner. I finally just asked the sushi chef, he looked at the waitress and man in black and it was like they were caught off guard. I'm sorry but the worst thing is room temperature sushi. But that is what I kind of got anyhow. Apparently, they don't chill their sushi rice before they start rolling because when you use warm rice, it makes the rolls fall apart as you pick them up with your chopsticks. No bueno.

I will say this, their rolls were pretty and I appreciated they were not lathered with sauce. But they used a lot of rice as filler. They had designs already on the plates and just put the sushi around them. At any other sushi bar, the chefs will usually put a design with sauces on an empty space on the plate. It adds to the esthetics of eating sushi. 

Then at the end of our meal, we just sat there while the two waitresses were chatting by the kitchen door with the two sushi chefs. Sorry, I've never seen something like that. Look at my reviews, I have eaten in many sushi restaurants around the tri-state area and this does not happen with sushi chefs. I will note they had the youngest sushi chefs I have ever seen in an actual sushi restaurant, not some place like Poke Bros. 

BTW, they were less than 10ft away from us, in plain view yet my mom had to wave several times at our waitress for her to notice. And they were not that busy at all, I think there were many two other tables of less than 4 people. Our waitress came over and we asked for a take out container and the girl finally took some dishes away. During our meal, I had to push my mom's soup and salad dishes out of the way because the staff didn't clear them. We only had so much room. 

As we got up to leave and I put a tip into the chef's empty jar and I got no acknowledgment, not even a head nod or a simple thank you. They were all too busy chatting to even say bye to us. I understand this place is new but with all the anticipation it was very underwhelming.

My mom ordered the pineapple chicken and crab rangoon. She liked them both.

I ordered their avocado ball; which was freaking delicious. Slices of avocado in the shape of a ball; inside spicy crab and fish. It was my favorite thing. 

Their presentation was beautiful; generous portions.

In my most recent order they forgot the ranch for the jalapeno poppers; and sometimes it's just little things like that that complete a meal for someone. And it's not like it was a special request it's standard with the order when you read their menu. Also, I specifically asked if their chicken torta was served as a whole breast and not cut up. I was assured that it was one piece of meat but that's not what I got in my order. The torta barely had anything on it and the bread was thick and hard. Plus the size of their salsa and guacamole is just the smallest I've ever seen from any Mexican establishment I've patronized. Their tortilla chips are good though.

I have ordered their lengua torta which was really good (their bread was soft and fresh!) and tonight upon recommendation from Victor I ordered their chicken ranchero with corn tortillas (which were the best I have ever had.) I had never ordered it before but all the ingredients were delicious. The ladies at the grill are doing some special back there. This food is fresh and it feels healthier.

Dave, whom I think might be the owner, responded promptly. For my first visit, it was just a friend and I. This restaurant seems to have once been a home and has since be converted. So, be mindful when parking, it's street parking and there are houses nearby. 

There is a painted sign out front and there is a sphere water fountain in front of the stairs. When stepping onto the porch there are two entrances; a door to your left and a door if you keep walking straight. I think it is seat yourself, because I've never seen anyone waiting at the door to seat people and I've seen other customers just walk in and seat themselves. Both times I've made reservations they have a little paper placeholder with your name and reservation time on it. I like that they use both sides of it; they seem environmentally conscious. They don't automatically put straws (or lemons) in your complimentary glass of water and their take-out containers are recyclable, if not biodegradable. I would describe Bellefonte Cafe's style as eclectic. I like that none of the tables, chairs match, and it is boldy colored with complementary artwork.

My 1st visit: As we were sitting down, I told the waiter I was communicating with someone running their facebook and asked to speak with them. Dave, the owner (I think), came over to our table to introduce himself. I like face-to-face communication after corresponding online in a situation like that; good owners care about their customers. He was nice to give me a complimentary dessert for my birthday. 

The waiter seemed to be, I don't know if distracted was the word to describe it, but something was off. One thing I wasn't a fan of was that he never came to ask how things were. They weren't that busy either so I don't know if there was something happening behind the scenes.  He was prompt with refilling our water glasses though. 

I ordered their Thai Chicken Salad (slided chicken breast, orange lime ginger sauce, black sesame seeds, scallions, seasonal greens, grape tomato, cucumber.) The greens and other veggies were super fresh. But the chicken was dry and the sauce was overpoweringly tangy. Also, I didn't taste any ginger. I think maybe that would have balanced out the sauce a little more.

My 2nd visit today was much better. Our waiter was a curly haired bearded guy named Dave. My mom and I weren't really interested in any of their apps so we shared an order of their Hummus Stuffed Avocado (half avocado stuffed with homemade hummus, topped with grape tomato, red onion, Kalamata olives, extra virgin olive oil, chopped herbs, served with crostinis.) It was really good. Their hummus was delicious! Also, the Kalamata olives were the best I've ever had. The ingredients go really well together, and I think it's perfect portion for two.

For my entree I ordered their Pine Nut Salad (roasted pine nuts, blue cheese, scallions, seasonal greens, grape tomatoes, cucumber, honey mustard vinaigrette) with chicken for an extra $2. Again, their veggies were very fresh. Their tomatoes and cucumber were my favorites. I asked for my dressing on the side. Dave dropped off our food and a waitress came over with the dressing a couple secs later. I tasted it and my mom tasted it and it tasted like regular vinaigrette. When we saw Dave, I asked about the honey mustard vinaigrette that was supposed to be with the salad. He went and got it but I don't know if there was confusion happening or what, but he said it was the same one that the waitress brought. But the one he brought, you could taste the honey mustard, with the other one, you could taste the vinegar. Regardless, they were both yummy. I just wanted to make sure I tasted both of them.

Also, they seem to have a musician every night around like 6:30ish. It's a fun atmosphere with good food. I'm sure I will be back and am looking forward to trying other things.

Well, I have to say, I'm glad I found this place. Just like most of the reviews write about, you are greeted as soon as you walk in and treated like family. My friend and I arrived around dinner time on Saturday, right before their dinner rush. Some regulars came in and the owners were joking and having a good time with them. It was nice to see.

I ordered a half rack of ribs, their Wah-wah (pulled pork sandwich) and their Gulaman juice.

My friend and I were originally going to get take out but we were so hungry and since I had to wait for my drink anyhow, we decided to eat there.

The only ""downside"" is that I wish my drink was ready in time to have with my meal because it would have been a nice pairing.

Don't people at parties usually bring a +1?

There was a ""head waitress"" (didn't get her name) with 2 or 3 other waitresses. I noticed the head waitress was a good sales person, trying to get people to order booze. Which worked, so Firebirds is lucky to have her; she is probably making them a lot of money. The wait staff were not that attentive.

Starter from their website: Lobster Spinach Queso (A spicy blend of lobster, baby spinach, tomatoes and pepper jack cheese with tri-colored tortilla chips).

It was not spicy at all and I could barely taste the lobster. It wasn't that the queso was bad and it was defiantly cheesy but I felt like a lot of flavors were lost. On the upside the chips were crispy and fresh; they were not greasy nor over salted.

Their mixed greens salad with diced tomatoes, sugar roasted pecans, cilantro-lime vinaigrette was pretty good. Although it was a little too saturated with vinaigrette and wasn't that great with flavor. I'm sure the restaurant knows this but the roasted pecans are what made this salad memorable; it was a nice balance with the tartness of the lime.

For the entree I had the salmon with Parmesan mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables. The salmon was good. You could tell it was fresh and it was cooked to my liking. The skin had a nice light crunch to it but the fish was moist and almost melt in your mouth in texture. I wasn't really interested in their veggies, which is sad because I like fresh veggies. There were only a couple yellow squash pieces but big chunks of peppers which I'm not a fan of. I did like the broccoli; it had a nice crunch to it but a not raw crunch. I like they used whole, unpeeled potatoes in their mashed potatoes but a little bland (garlic would be a nice addition.)

Finally for dessert, a piece of Big Daddy Chocolate Cake. Warning this thing is big enough for 2 people. The flavor of cake sort of reminded of a over sugary birthday cake you would get at the grocery store. And it was disappointing in other ways, the raspberry goo that was on the plate under the cake wasn't really flavorful at all and was sort of on the plate in blob. Also it had a little bowl with vanilla ice cream in it. It was nice to cut through the richness of the cake but I don't think they make their own ice cream because it reminded me of Breyers.

Honestly I'm not sure if I'd ever go again. Things are just being lost here because after all, it's a chain restaurant but they try to act like they aren't.",1,0,0,Sarah,509,865,252,146,43,3.41

My mom ordered the lobster crab cake entree and I had their Alamo Spring Roll (southwestern spiced slow cooked chicken with sweet corn, black beans & cheddar cheese. Egg roll wrapped and lightly fried. Served with avocado cream sauce) app. My mom enjoyed her food. 

As for my dish, the best thing about it was the avocado cream sauce. And as for being ""lightly fried"" it was a little more than that. The roll was cut into a couple different pieces, it looked pretty and was easy to hold. But a bite without the sauce wasn't really good and I asked for a side of the sauce to finish the roll. It was filled with more of the other ingredients than chicken. I was interested in other items on the menu, I just wasn't really hungry at the time.

Our waiter Fran, was nice and was accurate with our order. Although I was a little disappointed.

They had a nice little dining area. They didn't seem to have a paper menu; there were just pictures, descriptions of their items and prices. I ordered their lamb gyro to go with the tzatziki sauce on the side (so my gyro wouldn't get mushy on the drive home.)

I took a bunch of pictures and uploaded here.

I first want to say that I was hungry when I ate the gyro so that could have made me rate a little higher. With that said, this gyro was one of the best I've ever had. But seriously, the lamb was spiced and cooked nicely. I've had so many gyros in Delaware where the meat is overcooked and bland. Also they kept it simple, lamb, light onion, lettuce, tomato and tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki sauce was nice, a little sour, with dill and it was thin.

Apparently they have 2 different sites; because if you google their restaurant this pops up http://www.junctioneighteende.com/, but if you go to their facebook, the one I added to their yelp listing comes up. I made a reservation for my mom's birthday online. We had eaten there when it was the Skyline Grill but this would be our first time at Junction Eighteen. My reservation was confirmed through an email from Shawn Naylor.

The outside looked like the Skyline Grill except the sign. When we walked in, I gave the hostess my name and that we had reservations for 5:30pm. I don't think we needed to make a reservation because the place had less than 10 people; almost all of them were at the bar. We were seated to the right in their ""dining area"". My mom commented to me how cold it was and to confirm that, an older couple who had walked in asked if we were cold. We changed tables to the corner but I still had to wear my coat the entire time. 

Inside didn't look much different from the Skyline Grill either. Yes, there were more tables with new chairs, new booths, and they tried to give the place a higher class feel with the black color and place settings. But I don't think the walls were even painted, because where we were in the corner, you could see scrape marks where the white drywall was showing. Our waitress Samantha asked if we had been to here before, I told her we were when it was the Skyline Grill but this was our first time and mentioned it was my mother's birthday. She did acknowledge it by saying happy birthday. She took our drink orders and asked me if I wanted lemon with my water, which I told her no, yet I was served lemon anyhow. Also she mispronounced Pinot Noir.

We were told that the clams weren't available because when they got them, they were no good. That's originally what my mom wanted, but she ordered their New York Strip ($26) instead. We were told it was $8 burger night (which are normally  $11-$12) so I ordered their Gorgonzola burger with a side salad for an additional charge (instead of the fries that it comes with). Also, we had received a free appetizer (with the purchase of an entrée) flyer in the mail; with that we ordered their roasted red pepper hummus appetizer. 

The hummus appetizer was pretty good; though their menu stated they were toasted pita points, they were rather squishy as if they were just warmed up, not toasted. Also, for it being 'red pepper hummus' it was a little bland. Although, the cucumbers were good. My picture does not look like the picture that they have on their facebook; the one they have has some herbs on the tomatoes. The tomatoes we were served didn't have anything thing on them. I'm glad I was able to try this appetizer and it was free because it was literally the only ""healthy"" app they had on their menu.

My side salad was a nice size and the house vinaigrette was surprisingly different and good. It was light and sweet but not overpowering; I think I tasted some cinnamon. It would have been nice to see them make the little extra effort by slicing the tomatoes in halves. If you have ever tried cutting a cherry tomato at a table with other people, it can be fun (sarcasm). 

Before I finished my salad, my burger and my mom's entrée came out. Her steak was large and it had a small amount of sautéed (in butter) spinach and a potato cut up into slices. My burger was cooked how I asked and it was tasty. I think serving it on a brioche bun wasn't the best idea, because of the burger being so juicy, a bun like that just fell apart. I was left with a wet mess in my hand; literally dripping down my arm. 

Samantha did check on us a couple times (btw that older couple left without ordering anything because of how cold it was); when she asked how everything was my mom mentioned the cold and the things she liked about the food. Samantha then told us they had lost power yesterday. She asked if we wanted dessert, but we weren't really that interested so she brought us some take out boxes (nice they use recyclable plastic ones) and the check. When I was ready to pay with a card, I had to hunt her down and actually had to give it to the hostess when she came up to ask if I needed anything; since I was standing at the bar trying to pay.

The total was $49 with the free app coupon. I don't mind paying more for a good all around experience but for our first time here, and also, my mom's birthday, I was disappointed. When you know it's someone's first time into your restaurant, being a Wednesday night or not, that's the potential for a lifelong customer. I wasn't looking for balloons or anything crazy, but if a chain place like Applebee's can offer a free dessert, this restaurant with entrees over $25 can do something to make someone's night special, if they are looking for repeat business.

First off it is really nice inside, very clean with a huge main dining area. When you first walk in there is a private dining area if you wanted to have a meeting or a party. Also their bar area (which is a decent size also) is in the back away from the main dining area with large screen TVs. They also have a nice outdoor dining area which overlooks the river. I liked how the tables had paper on them instead of table cloths (which I hope they recycle)....also crayons were provided to draw on the paper and the waitress wrote her name on it when we were seated so we would remember her name. I thought that was a good idea since I didn't see name tags. 

I ordered a couple appetizers; fried calamari (which was yummy, although I didn't really like either sauce that it came with it) and a salmon dish (which I didn't know was served cold - wish it would have stated that in the menu - it almost looked raw, even though I was assured it was cooked) but either way I didn't want it. I've never sent something back at a restaurant so I felt sort of bad but the staff said it was fine. As my entree, I ordered the fresh seared twin filets, topped with Maine lobster and asparagus in a lobster cream sauce with corn on the cob and veggies as my 2 sides. The steak was so good! Had a nice crisp outside and an almost melt in your mouth center. But I was not really impressed by the ""sweet"" corn, which really didn't taste like anything; I had 2 bites of and didn't finish the rest (brought it home for the groundhog in my backyard); it was almost like it wasn't cooked long enough. Also, the lobster cream sauce was just gross (I'm glad I asked for it on the side) I don't know if that's how it is supposed to taste because it was the first time I have ever had it. But the sauce took away the flavor of the lobster and I didn't even eat more than the first bite. 

Since it was my first time visiting the Big Fish Grill I was treated with a free dessert. I chose a piece of peanut butter pie. It was HUGE and really really good. It reminded me of those Asher's peanut butter eggs for Easter.

I have wanted to check out this restaurant for a while now. Well, right now with the COVID-19 the Delaware Governor put all the restaurants on lock-down and are only available via take-out or delivery. Besides loving Korean food, I really wanted to make an effort to support smaller businesses in this time of so much uncertainty. And I am glad I did.

The woman who answered the phone was friendly and confirmed my order by repeating it back to me. I ordered their Korean chicken wings, Jaeyook bokum (spicy pork with veggies) and my friend ordered their tofu teriyaki. When I picked up my order it was just so sad; like the majority of restaurants in Delaware, their dinning area had chairs flipped over on the tables and a sign on the door with a notification of that on their front door; since no one can dine-in.

My order was already there and the woman at the register was so kind. Since this was my first time here, I didn't know they had already given me kimchi (my favorite thing) so I asked for some kimichi. Without hesitation she went in the back and brought me out some and put it in the take-out bag for me. I offered her some money and she shook her head as if to say, ""that is not necessary."" How sweet! But of course I still tipped. For that hospitality alone I would return, but the food....was delicious so I know I will be back.

First, those wings were cooked perfectly (and I don't use that word.) The crunch, the texture and the tender meat inside. And their sweet glaze on the outside. Mmm. Can I just say, fresh, fresh, fresh? My pork was cooked perfectly as well and the little fermented veggies inside the box were complementary to the spicy pork. 

When I ordered, I was asked how spicy would I like it, and I told her spicy and emphasized that. It was no where near burn your mouth but there was a noticeable spice to it. Also, it was not greasy! I have gotten this dish at other places and their pork is almost dripping with grease...meh. The spice was not overpowering and with the balance of the sticky rice (was really sticky) and veggies, I will totally order again. 

Also, their kimchi is on point fresh and I love how there were larger chucks which had a good bite, but it wasn't like a raw taste.

If Movies 10, next door was doing well, this location would do a lot better. Some businesses bring people into the area and it helps the surrounding businesses. 

Hachi didn't have to do much to the layout when acquiring Chaiyo (their main location in Dover) the previous business. It almost looks like the same place even with the wacky waving inflatable arm-flailing tubemen out front...I think there was an extra bar area added though. Sushi bar is still the same with the toaster oven and light fixtures.

I think this place opened up less than two weeks ago. We sat at the sushi bar and our waiter seemed a little new; nothing wrong with that, we all learn something at some point in our lives. There weren't many patrons there, but the same when Chaiyo was open. I did want to mention the sushi chef, he was great, personable. I've eaten sushi at many different restaurants and usually you are just greeted and said good bye to when you leave. But Johnny (not sure on the spelling) introduced himself to us. We had some ""special"" requests; meaning my friend didn't want eel sauce and I wanted salmon instead of tuna (seawoodwatch.com - be conscious of how your choices impact the ecosystem.) They had no problem fulfilling our requests. Also, we shared their spicy crab salad. 

Sadly, the crab salad was not good. The meat tasted not as fresh as I'm used to and the temperature throughout our meal was a little warmer than I like. This is one thing that sushi places overlook, there should be a little chill of fresh fish in your mouth. I just mixed it around with the spicy mayo and cucumber. 

I ordered the New Orleans Rolls and since I couldn't decide on anything else I just ordered the hair Mexican. My companion ordered the cooked Angry Bird roll and the Sweet heart roll. I did not realize that my New Orleans roll would have the same meat from the crab salad, like the Hair Mexican had. The eel sauce was good though, a little sweeter than I'm used to but still good. 

Also, there was a woman working there, I assume she was the manager because she was helping our waiter when he was putting the order in; like he was learning the system. Also, when my companion was struggling with the chopsticks, the woman came over with some ""baby"" chopsticks. They are training wheels for people; with a rubber band at the top with a space in-between the sticks. It was really nice of her.

Oh I forgot to mention, we were given a little sushi nom. That is another reason I sit at the sushi bar because some place care about the customer enough to give them a free sushi nom. But it too was warmer than I like...you just can't really taste the fish in all of its glory when it is warm.

After the entire situation I have been going back and forth with leaving a 2 or 3 rating..... Last night I checked out their website and they allowed online orders so I put in an order for pick up today; like most restaurants they use a 3rd party website for their online orders. Well, as you can see from my picture, they charge a 'convenience fee' which is typical for online transactions BUT I paid this restaurant CASH so I didn't use the online site for the transaction; which is what the fee covers for that company to make money. I predominantly use cash and no other restaurant I have patronized does this if you are paying cash. So, is the restaurant pocketing that fee?

Since I have to travel a good distance to this place I called right after I placed the order and left a message. I didn't want to put my cell phone number in that 3rd party site (read their TOS) so I left my order number and my phone number in the message. I never received a confirmation so I called today before my pick up time. From the minute I called there seemed to be confusion on the part of the restaurant. I asked if they got my message, the call was handed off to another employee. It sounded to be an older man, maybe the manager/owner, made it clear he did not want to listen to me by his repeated interruptions. He basically lectured me without hearing me at all. When you leave a message for a business after hours, they will typically return your call their next business day. This guy was almost irate making the assumption I thought they would check my message at 4am. 

Look, I don't know if there were just cultural differences or the guy maybe didn't eat lunch and was hangry. All I know is I felt like he was lecturing me as if I was his daughter, not okay. He just kept repeating the same thing and all I was trying to do was confirm they got my order. I had to basically ask for an apology because he just kept finding reasons to blame me. At one point he told me I didn't leave a message, then it was I must have called the boss's number and I responded with ""No, it is the number on your menu and I can show you the call log on my phone."" Are you serious? Does it need to be this way? You made a mistake...own it. Finally, I was able to confirm my order as well as the total since I was using their 20% off take out coupon on their site. I asked him about the 'convenience fee' and he said that was for use of the website.  That's not how it works if someone is paying cash but I was so over the conversation I just wanted to get off the phone.

I went to pick up my order and spoke to the man whom I spoke with on the phone. I told him he was really rude to me on the phone and his response was something like 'everyone says that' or 'why does everyone say that?' Maybe because you are being rude? He then again starts in on making excuses instead of just offering an apology and moving on. He tells me that he heard my message and that typically the kitchen staff doesn't check the messages. Right, it is the responsibility of the front staff to convey that to the kitchen staff not the customer's fault. He continued telling me he has be here (the restaurant) for 20 years..meanwhile my food is just sitting in the back. I told him that it was irrelevant if he is being rude to a customer and to just to apologize for it and drop it. He muttered something as he walked back to the kitchen; it almost reminded me of a child when the mom tells them go to apologize to someone and the kid begrudgingly complies.

At this point, most places would have actually offered the customer a free tea or something as a way to appease the situation (ie. factors; miscommunication within the restaurant, blaming the customer, being rude to the customer, the customer's drive, the fact the customer told you they came here just to support you.) This interaction with a customer could be the point where they might never return again. It isn't about the money in the moment, it is a good faith gesture to the customer you appreciate their business and want to continue that business relationship.

I normally tip smaller, family owned businesses 35-50% of the bill but after all this, I tipped with the change left from the bill (like $1.60.) I hated doing that but I also hate being spoken to like I'm a moron as a way to cover up another's mistake. Sadly, when I got home I noticed they didn't read the notes to my order. The food was good; rice was flavorful, the chutney was on point and the chicken was seasoned well and fall off the bone tender but honestly it was not worth all the other stuff...but the food was the reason for my 3 instead of 2 star rating.",0,0,0,Sarah,509,865,252,146,43,3.41

I really like the the chicken makhani (butter chicken), Tandoori chicken, Raita (sauce), Naan (which I made a sandwich with) and the tamarind. 

The restaurant was very clean and I liked the layout. I like how they had the salad and all the sauces on another table away from the buffet line.

I even took the steps to donate $100 so they could make food for a local assisted care facility. I made my first order a month ago and it was disappointing to say the least. First, it says on their menu they serve wings with celery. I brought my order home and there was no celery. Also the wings were pretty pathetic. So I called and spoke to whom I'm assuming was the guy behind the counter when I picked it up. He told me they don't serve celery and doesn't know why it's on the menu and basically didn't do anything regarding my comment about their wings.

So today I saw they posted on social media pictures of the same wings that I bought but apparently a new recipe. So I took that opportunity to call them out about my experience. One of the owner's immediately called me a liar. This guy wasn't even there and I had already sent him a private message regarding my first time experience that he never responded to.

I had the cell phone number of another co-owner because we were organizing this donation food drop-off a month ago. So I gave her heads-up to what was happening on social media and I was basically chastised for describing one of the employees that day when I picked up my order. Because I naively thought these business owners would look into this issue based on the time and date I gave them to find the receipt.

I am highly disappointed with this interaction with these owners. There's a lot of saving face pictures on social media that in my case I have not experienced.

You don't get to sit here and not listen to a customer and then call them a liar because you don't want to look into it. Absolutely disgusting. But because this guy is popular nobody will listen to my experience.

Edit: and throughout the day after leaving that comment under the post, his friends harassed me via social media. Now all these people are over the age of 30 and most of them are over the age of 40. I'm sorry if this is your normal and this is the way you want to live your life but being petty to random strangers for sharing their experience about something you have no knowledge about, is not your right and you need to stay in your lane. You don't side with someone just because you know them. You get the facts and then make your own opinion like an adult who has critical thinking skills. And we wonder why kids are so utterly broken when their own role models can't teach them basic social skills. Conflict resolution. Being respectful to another human beings opinion or experience. No keep the mentality of a middle school mean girl and just attack them via social media. Do a social media detox for your brain once in awhile. Interact with other human beings face to face. And because of this I lowered their rating to one star. Nobody's going to take the time to leave a review this long if there wasn't some kind of validity with their statement. Folks need to grow up and you lost yourself a customer as well as her friends and family. Thanks for showing you don't care about our business so in fact you really don't care about our community.

But the management is just subpar for today. I don't know if they don't pay their staff a high enough wage or they are struggling with COVID. But apparently Jimy Patel is the new franchise owner and by looking at his LinkedIn, he has been a franchise owner of failing businesses;  Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Checkers restaurants for a decade.

You would think being opened for 4-5 months they would have knocked out all the kinks. I had visited last week based on their hours listed on their drive-thru. Well, their lights were on but no one was answering the intercom or anything. I actually wound up calling the police to do a welfare check because there was a car in the parking lot and inside lights on but I saw no one. I didn't know if an employee was being robbed/raped in the back of the store. 

I had left a message asking for someone to call me back and since that didn't happen I made a complaint on their website. Days passed and I heard nothing so I reached out to them on Twitter; those employees were less than helpful. Finally I heard something from this Patel guy via email. He doesn't seem to have much customer service skills for someone who has been in this business for a decade. He wasn't a fan of replying through email and kept asking for my number. If I wanted to provide that, I would have on their complaint form. So I asked him twice for his business number and nothing. Days were going by and this was taking up more time than I really wanted to deal with. He gave me what I had originally asked for, the original meal I was going to order that night but for them to comp it. He gave me no coupon or anything.

So, I had to do extra work and actually call the restaurant to explain the situation. The employees Mickey and guy Jay were awesome. They used their critical thinking skills to remedy the issue. Although, disappointingly their milkshake machine was not working due to user error so I had to come back today for the milkshake. The banana is so legit. 

I feel bad for the good people who work here. Because they are reliant on others in the company to do their job. These owners need to take more of a role in their restaurants because stupid stuff like this shouldn't be happening because owners don't speak with staff.

It's been really cold so I don't usually get to chitchat with the owner because understandably he is keeping his truck window shut when you are done ordering. He has his menu, large, on the side of his truck and gives you a copy of the menu. The menu has his number and you can preorder.

The decor is really nice, relaxing. It's a little too low lit for me but it has a nice flow. Their place settings were nice. I brought my own chop sticks but they had a pair at each table (along with typical utensils.) 

For the 1st course I ordered, Crispy Shrimp Wontons - tropical mango salsa, jicama, avocado topped with a little bit of sirarcha. They weren't folded like typical wontons. But all the toppings stayed on the wonton. They were good...the sriracha was a nice addition but wasn't essential to the dish. 

For my 2nd course I ordered; Chilean Sea Bass Bento Box; teriyaki, shrimp & snowy chicken pot stickers, 4 piece California roll and some seaweed slaw. I thought it was pretty good. I like the bento box itself; it was heavy. I picked it up and brought it to another table that had better light, so I could get a good shot of it. The sauce they had covering the bass was, almost, a little too much. But I used it to dip my pot stickers into. I don't know how authentic this place is but the food was still good.

Served with Thai spicy and sour dressing."" It was a larger portion than I was expecting (as you can see in the picture I posted) it came with rice and a side salad. It too was marked ""spicy"" but was just flavorful. 

The staff was really good with not bringing everything out at once. I started with the Thai side salad with peanut sauce first, then when I was finished they asked if I was ready for my calamari. Then waited to bring my entree until I was finished my appetizer. I really liked that because there are some places that bring everything at once and it's just too much at once.

Their deck is nice; I am assuming this is where the country club for the Three Little Bakers golf course was located. The golf course hasn't been one in years and it's become very unkempt. 

I ordered their chicken nachos (to share) and they were pretty good.

This place uses Dietz and Watson meats and cheeses; which are always yummy. The only thing that I was disappointed with was that there was hardly any meat. I think it had 4 thin slices.

If more than 90% of the patrons of the dive in question are of the nationality of said cuisine..EAT THERE!   

Rivera Taco is no joke.   Having spent much time in Mexico, it was splendid to find anti-La Tolteca quality tacos!  They are served appropriately, with some onions, cilantro, and limes.   An occasional radish surprise is to be had.  

The Tortas are wonderful:  Excellent rolls, and super quality meats and avovados make the sandwich.  The Alambres is a cheezy, gooey, bacon-y calorie busting delight.  

If you've never tried tongue, this is the place to get it.   Once you get over the ""tongue"" thing (hint, imagine it's pot roast)..it will quickly  become a favorite.  

Another favorite is anything ""Al Pastor"" which is pork and pineapple. 

Make sure to order extra grilled onions...they are addictive!

Tonight was a few hits with some strikeouts.   

HOMERUNS: The bread and cajun butter, as always and the Capn Crunch chicken fingers.   The fingers were perfectly cooked, not greasy, and wonderfully spiced.  The vanilla sauce is a genius complement to the chicken.  

HITS:  My wife had the gator jambalaya.  Always very good, well sauced, and lots of protein.   The pistachio crusted chicken was also well liked by our friend.  Crunchy, juicy, and the pistachios added great flavor.  The corn / bean side was also intensely flavorful and may have been the best single item of the night.  

STRIKEOUTS:  Well, I struck out.  I ordered the perogies and the bourbon crawfish.
Somehow I've never had the perogies, and I LOVE perogies.  I'm pretty sure they are frozen supermarket Mrs T's perogies, served in an oily mess.  There must have been     1/8 cup of oil on 4 perogies.  The flavor was nice, once you got past the refinery sitting on the plate.  I ate 2.

The crawfish were worse.  It was microscopic crawfish (think salad shrimp size) sitting in an oily, horribly sweet bourbon sauce.  There was no hint of bourbon taste that could muster thru the sugar and oil.  I picked the crawfish out, ate no rice, and yet there was a pool of oil that was VISIBLE thru the rice.  

And to cap off the meal?   BAD bananas foster.  Ice cream: GOOD.  Bananas: GOOD.  Caramel?  A grainy mess.  It either wasn't cooked fully, or it was sitting so long that it recrystallized.   Akin to picking gum off a beach and chewing on it.  I worked around it and  at the bananas and the ice cream.

As soon as I was walked in, I was standing right next to the counter where the cook is frying up the ingredients that go inside the tacos on a griddle.  

It was a gray over cast day and I noticed some patrons eating big bowls of soup.  They only have two kinds of soup Menudo (no thanks) and some kind of pozole soup that is only offered two days out of the week.  With that in mind, I decided to only try the tacos. 

I ordered a chorizo, beef, and pastor (pork) taco.  The women told me uno momento and before I knew it, my order was ready.  The tacos come with an OUTSTANDING salsa verde, a lime, red and white onions, and cilantro.  

I tried the chorizo taco first and it was OUTSTANDING!  The chorizo had great flavor and a little bit of heat.  The tortillas where cooked over a griddle and were great!  Next, I tried the beef taco.  This taco was not what I expected.  The beef resembled the beef that is used on a cheese steak.  It was cut up into small, thin pieces.  I was a little skeptical and thought the taco would be bland, but I was wrong.  The beef taco had a nice flavor.  My final taco left was the pastor.  Again, did not look the way I expected it.  The pastor was cut into tiny bits and many of the pieces were over cooked.  The pieces that where not hard and crunchy had a nice taste.  This was my least favorite of the three, but it was still tasty.  

Overall, I was blown away with how great their tacos tasted.  They speak very little to no English.  If you are use to frequenting places that speak little English, you will not feel out of your comfort zone.  For those who are not use to it, don't worry about it.  You will make out fine.  I plan to make many more trips for their tasty tacos in the future.",5,1,1,Chris,125,302,44,104,6,4.23

The parking can be tricky and the surroundings can be a little intimidating to people not use to the area.  This location is small and is take-out only.  

I usually order the breast special, which comes with a breast, wing, and French fries. The chicken is fried golden brown and is delicious. The chicken is always moist.  The skin has a great crunch and flavor.  I can't walk out of Walt's without getting a bean pie.  Now a bean pie might sound crazy, but trust me, it tastes great.  If you like sweet potato pie, you will like the bean pie.  

The side dishes are traditional soul food items.  I haven't tried any of the side dishes. Thus, I can't recommend if they are worth trying or not.  The service is fast and friendly.

I won't bore you with the various protein options they have, but I do want to point out that there are a couple of vegan protein options.  I usually order the Zaikka chicken, which the server said is spicy, but I didn't find it spicy.  There are several Indian inspired sauces to choose as your condiments.  The last things to decide on are the toppings: masala chickpea, cilantro, red onions, etc.  I was glad to see that they have mango lassie.  It's a little small for the price.

We started our night with home made charcuterie.  There were several meats.  The waiter did mislabel one of the meats as Spanish Prosciutto..huh?  I thought that would be called Serrano ham and besides the meat looked and tasted like salami.   

Besides that, the dishes I ordered looked and tasted great.  I loved the scallops.  They tasted buttery on the outside (I guess from being basted in butter) and creamy on the inside.  They were cooked to perfection.  The lobster risotto is a great dish also! It has taken me a while to write this review so I forget the special that we ordered but that was good.

My first bite into the pizza was lack luster to say the least.  I was hoping the next few bites would be better.  Unfortunately, it did not get better.  My pizza was bland.  There was a pesto sauce drizzled on the pizza, but I didn't taste it at all.

Nah, this place is definitely a pub and a very small pub at that. There is a back area that I have never eaten in. 

The food is hit or miss. It's either a home run or a strike-out.  The fish tacos are a home run. The tacos were a little different than what I expected, but they delivered and were great.  On a different night they had a special on their hot dogs. The toppings on the hot dogs were original.  The only topping I can remember is the blue cheese and tomatoes. These hot dogs were not on the menu, but they need to be.  

The grand slam is their skinny truffle fry that has Parmesan cheese and herbs.  I have had plenty of truffle fries with Parmesan cheese before, but these fries might be the best I have tasted to date.  As Theo Huxtable once said on the Cosby show, they are ""jamming on the one!"" 

The strike-out for me was the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese comes with blackened chicken, apple-wood smoked bacon, peas, tomatoes, and of course a few different cheeses.  My mouth was salivating after reading the menu.  The presentation is nice, but the meal was very bland.

I usually stick with the original, which comes with cilantro and onions.  For the meats, I normally choose the chorizo and al pastor.  The chorizo taco is very good and spicy, to boot.  Thus far, I like this one the most. The Al Pastor is also good.  The meat is flavorful and sliced thin.  I tried the chicken and found it be bland.  

The store is small.  They do have tables for those who decide to dine in.  There is not much ambiance.  Once you walk in you will see Mexican candy on one side of the wall along with dried chili peppers.  They also carry ice cream popsicles, sodas, and my favorite: arroz con leche (Mexican Rice pudding).  The rice pudding is not homemade, but it is still delicious!  They do offer non-taco entries like tortas, but I come for the tacos. 

I get my order to go.  They wrap it up nice and tight so nothing spills.  You only get once sauce, which is a red chili sauce that has a great chili flavor and is HOT!  I wish they also gave a salsa Verde in addition to the red sauce.  Variety is the spice of life, right!

Switching to the Vietnamese portion of the menu, I like the chicken rice platter.  The Pho is just...eh.  It's not bad.  The broth had flavor, but faint. 

The store is clean and the customer service is great.  They have cans of Thai Ice tea which is fabulous and they sell Asian grocery products.

Bachetti Brothers is billed as a gourmet meat and market.  They have a lot of prepared foods.  On the day I went they had prepared mac and cheese, chicken marsala, pasta and meatballs and many other dishes.  This is idea on nights when one does not want to cook.  They are also caterers.  Not only can you taste some of their prepared food to the tast the quality of their cooking you can also step down stairs and see the various catering displays they have set up. 
 
In the freezer section, one will find frozen cakes, pastas, meats, and various stocks (including veal stock) that are made in house.  

Their deli section is top notch with a ton of options for lunchmeat.  They have 50 different sandwiches on the menu for lunch and you can customize your sandwich.  The lunch sandwiches come with a pasta salad and a desert.     

This is a nice place to shop for dinner or lunch.  Give it a try if you are looking for something different from the norm.",11,0,4,Chris,125,302,44,104,6,4.23

I was intrigued to see this historic movie theater turned into a concert venue.  As I walked down the steps towards the lower level concert hall, I was wondering why I did not hear a single note of music.  Especially since I was arriving well after the start of show  time.  The soundproofing they have in this building is amazing.  Once the usher opened the door, the music spilled out into the hallway.  

The interior decorating for the Queen is nice.  Held over from the original movie theater are the pipes from an organ that once existed in a life long ago.  There are many unfinished parts of the ceiling and walls, that in some strange way, seemed to preserve the history of this building.  The acoustics in this building are nice.  There is a balcony and lower level seating.  I found the seating to be a little strange on the lower level with tables set up to seat eight.  Seating at the tables is tight.  The set up reminds one of a comedy club rather than a concert hall.  Nonetheless, the seating did not interfere with the viewing of the performance and worked out well. 

I was not hungry, but the foodie in me had to try something from the menu.  I ordered the humus plate.  When the plate arrived, it looked like a smorgasbord with feta cheese, roasted cherry tomatoes, olives, hot peppers, eggplant, humus, and pita chips.  The platter was a lot bigger than what I was expecting.  The humus was good.  It wasn't the best but it was solid.  The pita chips were over toasted.  They eventually became too hard to bite into without risking a cracked tooth.  

As a Delawarean, it is nice to have a local place to see nationally recording acts without having to drive up to Philly.  The real plus is the fact it only takes me less than 30 minutes to get home after the show.  My first experience at the Queen was enjoyable.

Their food is elevated for a brewpub and I'm surprised they do not consider themselves a gastro pub.  They make their own beer and only sell their own beer.  So if you come looking for a beer to drink other than Iron Hill's own, you will be out of luck.  Don't fret because Iron Hill has very good beer. My de facto beer is the Vienna Red Lager.  This beer has a medium body, beautiful red color, and nice finish.  Their seasonal beers are exceptional.  Their Pumpkin beer is a must have!  It's not too sweet and has a nice flavor.  

They have some stellar dishes on the menu.  The crab cake sandwiches are good.  They are baked, not fried, with a lot of jumbo lump crab meet and not too much filler.  Their pizzas are outstanding!  I don't know this for sure, but I'm willing to guess they have a wood oven, because you can taste a slight hint of wood smoke in the pizza.  They offer normal dough or malted barley dough.  I prefer the normal dough.  The barley is not bad, but not my cup of tea.  The Brewski burger is a bacon cheeseburger and pairs well with their sweet potato fries.  These fries quite simply might be the best sweet potato fries I have eaten.  They are cut real thick, so you really taste the sweet potato.  

The Wilmington location has two levels and a upper level outside deck that is very popular during the spring and summer months.  Iron Hill is great for a date night, hanging out with friends,  or taking out of town coworkers for lunch or dinner.  

I've been eating at Iron Hill Brewery for many years and I'm a member of their mug club.  They have other locations located through out the Delaware Valley.  I worry that if they open up too many locations the quality of the food would go down hill.  I'm glad to say my fear has not come true thus far.

My first impression was this place is small but decorated nicely.  As usual, I was having a hard time trying to decide what I was going to order after surveying the menu.  I decided to start my evening off with risotto that had foie gras and figs.  I like to think that I'm not a bad cook, but let me tell you, my risotto has nothing on Moro's.  It was nice and creamy. The consistency and texture reminded me of rice pudding.  Moro's risotto is the best I ever had.  

For my entree, I went with the Bronzino.  My fish had tomatoes and nuts that were hidden in the fish.  I can't remember everything that was on my fish but it was freckin' good!  My wife ordered the slow braised short ribs.  I tasted a piece of hers and it was spot on.

We ended the night with Budino dessert.  You learn something new all the time.  I did not know Budino is Italian for pudding and that's exactly what it was...a flavorful pudding.

Johnnies sells a variety of hot dogs with the toppings based on iconic foods of cities or states that the hot dog is named after.  

For example,  the Philly dog comes with grilled onions and cheese - a play on a cheese steak.  There are so many choices and I'm  always overwhelmed with making a decision.  My favorite is the Chicago dog.   The toppings that come with the Chicago dog are: mustard, relish, onions, tomato, peppers, dill pickle and celery salt.  Johnnies also sells a veggie hot dog.     

Oh yeah, their fries are excellent!  They sorta remind me of Thrasher's French fries that are sold at beaches on the Delmarva peninsula.  The service at Johnnies is always great!

The tomato sauce is not too tangy or too sweet and it is loaded with garlic.  The cakes are moist and you can taste the butter in the vanilla flavored cakes. I usually get the butter cream icing.

I also like to get the sfogliatella and sticky buns from time-to-time.  This is the only place I had sfogliatella so I can't honestly critic them.  The sticky buns are okay.  During Christmas, they carry panettone.

This restaurant is also labeled as a wine bar.  They do carry a lot of wines, but it is different than most wine bars I've been to.  The main difference is that they don't serve meals as tapas.  The entrees are hardy and will leave you with a full stomach, but I'm getting ahead of myself.  

The restaurant is located on 9th street in Wilmington.  It's a small restaurant.  So needless to say, that when we showed up with no reservation, there was no place to sit except for the bar.  I perused the cocktail menu as well as the wine list and the Pisco Sour caught my attention.  I'm familiar with this drink, but I never had one, so that was the drink I ordered to start my night off.  Pisco Sour definitely lives up to being sour, but not too sour.   It reminded me of a margarita.  

For my entree, I decided to go with the Pescado En Salsa Blanca.  This entree is a large piece of tilapia with mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallops served with a béchamel sauce on top of spinach.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The scallops had a nice buttery taste.  The shrimp were big, and there were a nice portion of mussels.  This dish was very good.

My favorite dish on the lunch menu is Mee Siam.  I normally get it with chicken.  I'm in freaking love with this dish!  I can't stop ordering it.  This dish features Mei Fun noodles, with celery, bell pepper, egg, onion, & scallions.  The flavors meld perfectly and make this dish divine.  Occasionally, I will stray away from the Mee Siam and order Kee Mao Fried rice, Pad Kee Mao, and Pad Kra Pao.  I can personally say that all of these dishes are stellar.

The menu is Asian fusion, which has Chinese, Japanese, and Thai dishes through out the menu. 

The sushi menu has a nice variety and the sushi is decent.  I have eaten many of their rolls through the years.  I'm a fan of he crunchy spicy yellowtail and the spicy yellowtail rolls.  The spicy tuna roll is just okay. Their ""Creative Sushi Rolls"" are good.  I usually order the crunchy sea treasure roll that has tempura shrimp and topped with tuna.  I tried the Angry Tuna Roll and was not a fan.  This roll uses a lot of black pepper to make it ""Angry"".   Too much black pepper for my taste buds.

When it comes to the cooked portion of the menu, the Thai spiced lamb is outstanding.  The lamb is tender and not gamey.  I love spicy food and the dish delivers.  It is definitely on the hot side, so this dish might not be for you if you don't like a lot of spice.  General TSO Chicken is another dish that is good.

The Mexicano features a fire roasted corn and poblano sausage, cheddar cheese, and a chipolte mayo.  I've also had the Thai Curry and Roman chicken sausage sandwiches.  They are both equally good.  

My new favorite is the spicy Italian sausage.  This sandwich is simplicity at its finest and the Italian sausage is excellent.  Mass produced Italian sausage doesn't taste as good as the ones I remember eating as a child, but this sausage delivers!  It has whole fennel seeds in the sausage that gives it a nice, unexpected crunch, and a pop of flavor.  The homemade pickles are sweet and great.  

A display case in front of the store has their homemade sausages for sell.  The sausages seem to rotate.  The German landjagger sausage will delight your taste buds.

The tripa was okay, but it wasn't what I was expecting. This was the first time I've had tripe tacos, and I didn't realize it would be breaded and crispy. It was good, but probably not to my preference. The lengua, however, was great. It's one of my favorite (real) taco meats, and it was flavorful and tender. They also had chorizo and bistek that I didn't get to try on this visit, but I'll definitely be back for the lengua tacos and to try some of the other menu items.

I'm also obsessed with the lime shallot sauce. I think it's so good, but it can get lost in the burrito, so I like to get it on the side so I get a hit of that bright, oniony flavor with each bite.

I had to have uncooked sea creatures. To eat. Large amounts.

I started off with their sashimi sampler, which I thought was decent, but I expected better quality from the kind of restaurant Harry's wants to be. I had asked for no wasabi because I have a strong aversion to horseradish, but they ended up using wasabi flavored roe to decorate the scallops. The most egregious offense, however, was stacking the scallops on a slice of lime. Sure, it made for a nice presentation, but the bottom piece was partially ""cooked"" from the citric acid by the time I got to it. All in all, the sashimi scratched an itch, but it wasn't something I'd rave about.

Next up was my oyster tray. I got a sampler of all the different oysters on the menu, which was fun since I'm still learning my oyster preferences. They came with a really good cocktail sauce, a lemon-pepper oil, and two, measy slices of lemon. The presentation was nice, but I'm less refined when it comes to my oyster toppings of choice. All I need is a good squirt of lemon juice with a dash of tabasco to go along with that plump, delicious bit of flesh that tastes like the ocean. I also ordered a side of fries since everybody around me had fries on their plate, and I started to get fry envy. The fries were delicious, and a nice accompaniment to the meal.

All in all, I had a good experience with Harry's. The service was good, the outdoor seating was nice, and the food was decent. One service issue I had is that they brought out my sashimi and oysters at the same time. I wasn't expecting that since most places that seem as nice as Harry's would give consideration to the timing of their food, especially since I was dining alone. It was mostly a minor issue, but the higher you get in restaurant quality, the more important smaller details become. When I got my bill, I didn't think the quality of my meal was worth what I paid, but that's what you get with places like Harry's sometimes, who strive to be higher quality dining than what they're capable of.",1,2,0,Sarah,68,80,30,34,4,4.21

Seems like a fun place for a happy hour since they have those giant beer tap things you can order, but at the same time, what good can a happy hour be if you have to drive home? 

I came here for my birthday because I had to drive back to Richmond that night, and my roommate and I joked about going to this place since we had stayed a month at a nearby hotel. I ordered a birthday pina colada with no alcohol (driving, boo), which was delicious! It's in my profile picture, actually, and came with cute sunglasses pin in the fruit. Obviously, it doesn't take much to please me.

We ordered the chip dip trio as an appetizer, and while the salsa and guacamole were lackluster, the crab dip was delicious. I ordered the shrimp tacos for an entree, and they were satisfying, considering the place we were at. Service was fine, ambiance was ""beachy"".

I went on a Thursday for lunch time, as off reviews I was expecting for a ""high end"" Mexican place and I only found a highly expensive, wannabe Mexican cocina...

You don't serve dirty water glasses when you charge an average of $13.00 per dish...

Guacamole served with grey areas (old avocado )

Tortillas for tacos are also not what you expect for a $ 14.00 skirt steak tacos ... that is nothing but Walmart low quality tortilla...

Last when you ask for salsa if you quoted your restaurante as a Mexican place... you don't bring bottled Tampico sauce...

Very disappointed!!!! You can get way better food and times more authentic Mexican in the area, for less in a better and fancy looking environment ... (DELPEZ for instance)

I was lucky enough to get a reservation for a Thursday night in early October, perfect to celebrate both my birthday and the birthday of my beautiful girlfriend. Had to get the reservation more than a month in advance, but regardless, we were excited to see what all the fuss was about and to see if it was possible to live up to the serious and significant hype. 

Spoiler alert - it did. And then some. What a beautiful meal. It is perfectly appointed inside - small and nicely decorated, comfortable and fancy upscale. We arrived a few minutes early for our 7pm reservation and were seated immediately. Our server couldn't have been better - friendly, polite, attentive, knowledgeable. The drinks were both perfect. They premiered a new special cocktail, a frozen boozy spiced apple cider, and the birthday girl loved it. I am a big fan of Wilmington Brew Works and was delighted to find they have their own special proprietary IPA  - it was awesome. We started with the whole roasted head of organic garlic, served with homemade grilled sourdough bread, extra virgin olive oil and honey-rosemary mascarpone cheese. Yum! We also decided to try the pork belly gua bao asian buns, and they were remarkable. Not a usual starter at a fancy steak place, and a real treat.

The meat did not disappoint. My lovely GF enjoyed her 6 oz filet mignon, perfectly prepared, and I thought the steak frites were perfect. The fries were hand cut and seasoned perfectly, and the 8 oz of steak sliced could not have been better. Incredible.

We indulged in the chocolate ganache tart with sea salt caramel sauce, a perfect birthday dessert split. What a meal, what a night.

Giving them two stars is a stretch. The Italian hoagie, the roll was this soft cheap tasting roll, with very little meat and no cheese! When I say very little meat I'm talking enough meat to put on a roll the size of your palm. The onions were these thick chunky things. Seriously worst hoagie ever. I'd rather eat subway. The cheese steak was just as bad. 

Upon arrival (30 minutes after ordering) the person in the front asks did you put that cheesy bread in and the cook responds no. So had to wait an additional 10 minutes. And the cheesy bread was awful. Maybe because it wasn't done all the way?

Great food and drinks, reasonable prices, great atmosphere, ask for MARIAH, best server!

Discovered this place today and went in to try it with my sister and mother who is in town. We didn't have a reservation, but we only had to wait about ten minutes. Cloth napkins, nice silverware, brought water out right away. Very nice little place, lots of beer and wine to pick from, delicious menu, all at reasonable prices. Our server was MARIAH, 10/10 would recommend, definitely ask for her! She was bubbly, fun, helpful, attentive, energetic, friendly...You name it, one of the best servers I've ever had. I had to go compliment her manager, she was so terrific. Drinks never got low, dirty dishes never piled up, I never felt like I needed something and had to wait for her to come around to order. Let me put it this way: I didn't pay for dinner, yet I still tipped her extra because she 110% deserved it.

Anyway, I ordered the Buckley Burger with sweet potato fries, and had devoured it before anyone else had even finished half their plate it was so good! We were also able to try a dessert that had a brownie and vanilla ice cream, pretty sure it said the ice cream was from Woodside! Very delicious. 

I have already texted my boyfriend and told him I'm going back and bringing him with me. What a wonderful place to stumble across, and hands down to Mariah for making it so memorable and special.",0,0,0,Kapri,10,7,0,2,0,4.73

The food here is great! Almost all the meals I've had here have been above satisfactory (with a few hit or miss dishes). What I love most about this little spot is the intimacy it offers. It's a little corner restaurant that is unapologetically a little rustic and a fusion mess (in a good way). It's definitely got a different style with eating utensils stored in a little mason jar in the middle but it's the ever changing poster that always makes me want to come back and see what else is new. 

They have a special menu, one that seems to change monthly but I'm also surprised to note their menu changes also (it seems to be one dish here and there) but for a (sometimes) vegetarian, it's a good change. 

Recommendations:
- korean chicken wings. I will admit I hated wings until I tried these. With just the right amount of spice and (not breaded!!!) I will not hesitate to get a little messy to thoroughly enjoy these wings
- jalapeno pesto pizza. A very good meal (the first one I probably had) They're not afraid to add spice to their menu which is always an added bonus
- goat cheese toasts. You just can't go wrong with a combination of goat cheese and honey. 
- buffalo caulifower - I seem to like spicy things here but they seem to do it justice 

Hit or miss:
- black bean burger. It was basic and there was nothing in it that made me want to come back just for this.
- wild mushroom flatbread. There was just too much honey and it became overwhelmingly sweet with no other flavor to balance it.",2,0,0,Prashasti,112,118,18,42,7,3.63

The lunch menu is quicker (obviously) but not without enough options for all tastebuds. The food is served much faster and the spot is near corporate parks so thus, it's expected to be a busy hot lunch spot. The experience at the restaurant makes up for the average quality of food - the waiters are very attentive and ask the right questions. For example, if you order fried rice with vegetables, they'll ask you if having egg in your fried rice is ok or not. 

I tried Mango chicken for a lunch meal which was an average spicy dish (not too extraordinary) but the tofu satay is to DIE for !!! It looks like it's spicy but it's savory and a little bit sweet due to the peanut sauce, an absolute dish to try. Had the Thai pineapple fried rice and I was impressed with the presentation more than the actual dish. It came in half a pineapple as a serving bowl and (much to my dismay), it was a bit too egg-y for my liking.

There was live music when we were having dinner so that was nice (there was just a slight hesitation because the speakers were so close to us that it was hard to have a conversation, so maybe don't have speakers because the place is small enough that everyone can hear the music). 

The second time I went, it was a much nicer day, so we sat outside. I got the hummus stuffed avocado and my friend got the chickpea fajitas. The avocado was such a big meal and it was really heavy too! The chickpea fajitas were delicious - spicy with a little bit of curry. Very unexpected.",1,0,0,Prashasti,112,118,18,42,7,3.63

I settled on a few menu items and clearly stated that I wanted the gluten free, vegan versions of the dishes.

Gluten Free / Vegan Buffalo Cauliflower - because their buffalo sauce is dairy based, this dish is not buffalo at all.  The waitress said that the cauliflower would just come with the buffalo sauce and not the cheese.  I was fine with that.  When the dish arrived, it was just fried cauliflower, no sauce, no flavor.  The manager came and apologized for the mix up. The buffalo sauce had dairy.

Another downfall is that our party of 3 was seated in the bar area.  It was very loud and difficult to hold a proper dinner conversation.

The kitchen is really aware of gluten intolerance issues so it's an absolute pleasure to dine there.

Small details like the cayenne-cinnamon popcorn and sparkling water at the table add big bonus points for me. 

Also, every server I've encountered has been relentlessly nice, friendly, and helpful. All around this place is really enjoyable.

 I was here before with my wife and service plus the food was 5 stars.  Unfortunately,  on Feb 14th,  the restaurant definitely let my wife and myself down.  We were taken to a table where after 10 mins no one came and took our drink orders.  I had to get up and ask for service.  We finally got the drinks.  For a 2nd time,  no one came to get our food order.  At this point,  we were about to leave,  but she had her heart set to come here.  Once again went to the counter and asked if we could get service to get our food.  We received the food (delicious).  After all of this I would assume they would give us a check.... Seems like they just wanted us to have free food since there was no one waiting on our table and no check given.  Finally I had to get up to get someone to give me a check.

They serve every meal with giant glasses of iced tea or soda and the second that glass gets low the staff has a new one coming out the second you're almost done.  

The food is delicious Tex Mex cuisine with some creole type flavors as well.  We have never waited more than thirty minutes for a table even at rush hour.  They really get people served and in and out in record time.  

I can't say enough good things about this place and would recommend for out of town people or even people who usually love Mexican food because I feel like this is really good food.",0,0,0,Phil,14,7,2,0,0,2.88

Located in old new castle this is a converted house turned restaurant from colonial times.  Everyone dresses the part and you'll see a lot of people that look straight out of old times.  It's a lot of fun right off the bat and reminds me of something they would try and replicate at Disney world in Epcot center.  

The chicken pot pie might be the most delicious thing I have ever eaten.  It is simply incredible.  The other food is really good too.  

There are a lot of beers here.  I don't have a precise count but it's in the hundreds and the beer menu is probably twenty pages or more.   

Since it's an old house it is very tight in there and there are no tvs so if you're coming to the bar you're literally just there to drink and converse with friends.

The only knock you may have is, it is not a cheap evening out to dinner and the chairs are not very friendly to a bad back.  You will wind up spending a decent amount of money on food but since it is scratch made you can understand the extra costs involved with doing that and the decor has to fit in with the place so the hard chairs you can deal with.

Needless to say the kitchen is clean enough to eat off the floor according to them.  

This is traditional bar food and just your regular neighborhood bar.   The food is of a good quality although not sensational or anything you would really tell people about because they don't really have a signature dish or anything that you can't get elsewhere.   

There is something comforting knowing they pass all food inspections with flying colors.  That alone should make you feel good eating there.  

Beer selection is adequate but not outrageous.  You may find some bottles of things that you hadn't seen but the taps are full of generics more or less.

I knocked off a couple stars because we stopped going after having terrible service here when we went the past time.  

Our waiter actually was sitting down and chatting with a table of his friends and did not come back to check if we needed anything.  When he did I said I had ordered a glass of wine that never came out.  This was probably twenty minutes after ordering or so and no one ever came to check on us in that time.  Our waiter came to our table three times for the entire night.  Once to sit and take our drink and food order, once to see if we needed anything when I asked for a glass of wine and then finally to bring the bill when I signaled him as he was sat chatting with friends and not doing his job.   He also claimed the glass of wine ""definitely came out"" which was kind of in a tone that he didn't trust me that I didn't get that second glass of wine.

Unfortunately, when I arrived there I realized from Yelp as I was about to get out of my car that they only accept cash and I only had $8 on me :(

I checked Yelp for nearby breakfast places. My second choice, Kozy Korner, also did not accept credit cards, but Eeffoc Cafe did, so I settled upon it.

For the positives, the parking is incredibly easy, it's in Trolley Square, the food arrived piping hot in a record time, they have wi-fi for up to an hour, and the place is clean and beautiful outside. I am kicking myself for not sitting outside, especially since today was one of the first really nice days this spring. I think it was 70 degrees this morning.

Now for everything else. The food was incredibly subpar. I got three pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns. The pancakes were the best, and they weren't  bad. Certainly not as good as a breakfast franchise like Perkin's or Cracker Barrel, but still acceptable. They were incredibly hot, which helped and they were fluffy. The problem was how small they were. I mean they weren't like dollar pancakes small, but still- I would have expected a little more from a place that specializes in breakfast.

The bacon was hard and unenjoyable. The hash browns were of the McDonald's ilk. And I don't know what the hell was up with the scrambled eggs. I've come to accept that no food establishment can make scrambled eggs as good as my mom, but this took it to a whole new level. Rubber. Pure rubber.

My biggest complaint was the service. The old guy with the beard looks like he's being tortured when you try to converse with him.

""Hey, what's going on man?""
Blank stare with no response
""Uh, I'll have the pancake special.""
""Toast.""
""What?""
Exasperated by me not understanding his question ""Do... you... want toast.""
""Uh, sure. Actually, no, I don't need toast.""

Well old bearded worker at Eeffoc Cafe, here's a tip. When you ask a question, change the inflection of your tone such that your pitch gets higher at the end of your question. Then maybe you won't have to be so exasperated when you have to repeat yourself.

Two last things I ordered; a cheese danish and a fresh-brewed unsweetened iced tea. The danish was pretty good, the iced tea I'm really not sure about considering I had two sips after I accidentally spilled 90 percent of it on the floor. Now I do understand that spilling it was my fault, but 95 percent of all places will still refill it out of courtesy. This guy has a scowl on his face and gives me a towel to wipe it up. 20 ounces of unsweet tea probably costs 15 cents. You really can't refill it?

Fast forward ten years. I'm a man, with a beard; having seen the world. I've seen the good and bad that this life has to offer. I got done my shift at work and decided to vary from Cacciatori's/Tony's and head over to Two Cousin's.

The pizza was remarkably average. It wasn't bad; but I think most microwavable pizzas are just as good. The Old Bay fries took 15 minutes to make, but they were pretty good.

Guess who's back for another amazing Yelp review? They don't know (they don't know)? Bet they know as soon as they read a couple paragraphs, it's J-Crow!

What's up Yelp? I've been busy with school lately, and have only had time for a review here and there, but I thought I had to sign in and post about this awesome Chinese jawn, especially when I saw it only had 3 stars.

I went here at around 6 o'clock tonight in search of a place that was still a. open b. accepted credit cards and c. wasn't on the Northside (cough cough China King). Joyful Garden delivered.

I got the General Tso's with the egg roll for like $8. First off, as you can see from the picture, I just want other Chinese places to take note at the chicken/broccoli ratio. NO ONE LIKES BROCCOLI. Got it? It only adds to the aesthetics. I don't think anybody actually bothers eating them. The chicken was pretty good, not burnt, but the best part was the delicious sauce that it was drenched in. I mean they really caked that sh/it in, and I just want you to know, JG, I appreciate it. 

The place was also well run, and had fast service. If you're looking for Chinese on the west side, this is your place. 

Also, there was a sign that made me laugh. Someone already posted a pic of it, so I won't, but it was a picture of lettuce that said: ""WOW!!! GREEN LEAFY VEGETABLES. EAT MORE GREEN MORE HEALTHY"" 

First off, no one gets that excited over a picture of lettuce, and also, who the hell wrote that sentence? Did the guy have a nephew with Down Syndrome and he put him in charge of the signs? And that's no disrespect to the awesome Down Syndrome community. But that is sometimes how they write. Anyway, if I didn't already sell you on this place in my review, I hope that sign will.

I came here on the recommendation with the affirmation that they had the best cheesesteaks in Delaware. Better than Goodfellas? Nooooo way, I said. I was right.

The cheesesteak was one of the more inferior cheesesteaks I had in my life, probably on par with Tony Luke's or Sonny's up in Philly (at least inferior cheesesteaks from a reputable cheesesteak vendor, so gas station cheesesteaks I consumed while I may/may not have been intoxicated don't count). The best way I can describe the actual meat of the cheesesteak is fine-cut dipping tobacco. It was granulated to the point that you wouldn't recognize it as beef if it wasn't placed in the sandwich. Then there was very little cheese (which was probably a good thing because it wasn't good). But my biggest beef (no pun intended) was with the roll. Hey Greenhill, what the @#$%???? The roll was so soft and flavorless. It was the type of roll I'd expect from a homeless shelter on Thanksgiving, not an actual place that sells cheesesteaks for a profit.

So why aren't they getting one star? The pizza, which was amazing. I saw it while I was waiting for my order and it looked really good so I told them to throw in a slice of unheated pepperoni. I am very glad I did. Probably a top 5 slice of pizza. That's what they need to focus on. Forget the subs, allocate all resources to mass producing their pizza. I'll definitely be back for more of it.

Aside from the food, the place is very pleasant. It's located in West Wilmington (the only Wilmington) and has a really cool place to sit outside, which not too many Wilmington food establishments have. The guys were inside were real cool too. Tons of Phillies posters, and the guy was nice enough to give me directions from St. Elizabeth's (most Wilmington places when asked for directions will pull the classic Hangover: ""It's on the corner of get a map and f--k off""). 

Overall, I'm glad I went to Greenhill. Go for a slice, but skip the hoagies. If you've read my other reviews, you'll know your go-to's for sandwiches are Capriotti's, Goodfellas, and Capriotti's.

The ribs were unbelievably meaty. The sauce was a little lacking (you have to put most of it on yourself), but it couldn't detract from how meaty the actual ribs were. The main gripe I have with ribs in general is that there isn't enough meat. Not a problem at Locale's. The food was also delivered ridiculously fast.

Minor complaints include the lack of soda options, and the substitution of coleslaw for corn bread. WTF Locale's.

I was making the trek, as so many Delawareans do everyday, from Newark to Wilmington. I passed by the new Wawa on Kirkwood Highway, and then I realized I wanted to stop there- but I passed it and it was too late. It was 11 in the morning, and I was still kind of tired and starting to get hungry. I just resigned myself to going to the McDonald's in Elsmere, which would have been a pain with the u-turn I would have had to make. I like McD's breakfast; don't get me wrong, but Wawa's is certainly better. Then, as I'm driving past Mark's barber shop, I glance to my left and look upon a glorious Wawa. I had completely forgotten there was one in Elsmere. Oh, happy day.

Wawa is better than McD's for breakfast in numerous ways. The coffee's better, the Sizzli's are better than the McMuffin, they have pastries if you want something sweet with your coffee, and they're self-serve, which makes the lines go faster.

I don't get all the negative comments for this location. The parking is easy, and all the workers are super friendly. The one-star reviews must be from teenagers trying to buy blunts who can't from here because Wawa scans ID's, unlike sketchy gas stations.

I love a good slice of pizza. Particularly, I like a NY slice, and I like a real Italian slice (though I don't see them that much). This place had both, but I opted for the NY slice, and got two slices of pepperoni and sausage pizza.

They were amazing. I mean look at the picture. The pepperoni slices were huge, and the sausage was actually meaty sausage, unlike what you would find at Domino's. It was one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had in my life. In fact, if I were to rank my top 5, it would go:

1. Cacciatori's Buffalo Chicken Pizza
2. DiMeo's Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza
3. Greenhill Deli Cheese Pizza 
4. Tony's Cheese Pizza
5. Grotto's Cheese Pizza

I might get a lot of sh/it for putting Grotto's on that list, but I personally feel that they are the flavor of Delaware summer. Just me. Back to DiMeo.

Everyone was super friendly, and the place was amazingly clean and upscale for being downtown. They had beer, unsweetened tea, and Coke Zero. You can't beat that.

I can't wait to go back to DiMeo and try their other Italian entrees. I'm sure they will be just as amazing as the two slices I got yesterday!",4,0,2,Fred,109,85,52,13,1,3.66

I got a lamb gyro, some fried chicken, and fries with ice cream. The gyro wrap was just average, and Mediterranean Grille in Newark has far superior gyro's, and Semo's on 9th Street makes a lamb platter over rice that is delicious and better, especially when you put on their white sauce. But the place isn't called Kennedy Gyro Wrap.

The chicken was pretty good. Again, Semo's is better, but it was probably top 3 fried chicken I've had. I'm the rare Delawarean who doesn't think Walt's is pure gastronomic art, so I would say this place is better, but I'm in the minority on that one. The chicken did need salt and a little ketchup (which Semo's doesn't need), but the actual meat was great. 

But the highlight of the meal was easily the fries. They were freaking amazing. So crispy, and full of flavor. They reminded me of the fries at McGlynn's in Pike Creek. If you're in the area and want a snack, don't get a bag of chips. Get these fries.

Add on a delicious double scoop of ice cream, and I really enjoyed the meal. The only problem was the wait, which was long, but the worker apologized and said that they were experiencing technical difficulties (and I saw the fryer was acting up).",0,0,0,Fred,109,85,52,13,1,3.66

The food was edible. But it was so bland. And expensive. It's like $14 for an 8 inch steak, tater tots, and a 12 oz. can of soda. I mean, come on. If I'm spending $14 on an EIGHT INCH cheesesteak, it better be %$!@ amazing. Pat's up in Philly, the biggest cheesesteak tourist attraction in the number one city for cheesesteaks, charges less money and gives you a bigger steak. And they basically are a monopoly with tourists. If you're a local, you know where else to go for a cheesesteak, but if you're visiting, or on business, you're going either to Geno's or Pat's to buy a steak. They could each charge $16 for a steak, and their sales wouldn't be affected, but they don't. They charge a reasonable price. One last thing on prices; Olympic charged extra money for tomatoes. What? Tomatoes? Why don't you charge $14 for a cheesesteak, and then an extra 50 cents each for steak, cheese, and the roll while you're at it.

The actual cheesesteak didn't even taste that good. I see what they're doing with topping ""tons"" of meat on top, and how people love it and feel like they're getting a deal, and maybe it works for subs, but not for a cheesesteak. The steak was not juicy, the amount of cheese was VERY small, and the roll was soggy and awful. The steak tasted more like something you'd buy in Seattle, not Wilmington;  less than 30 miles from Philly.

Another complaint is the cleanliness. Some places are very clean, like Goodfella's; other places aren't as clean, but give off a gritty, blue-collar vibe. This place was neither. It was dirty, and depressing. It looked more like Jack's Country Maid than it did Capriotti's.

If you're in the area, and want a sub, go to Gaudiello's in Trolley Square. They won't nickel-and-dime you, and they make the best Italian hoagie you'll ever taste. They're also very friendly (it's a husband and wife) and accommodating. If you want a cheesesteak, walk six blocks down to Bain's Deli on 2nd and Market and get a cheesesteak. Their steaks are delicious, and the place is clean. I gave both of those places 5 stars.

Olympic's fails. The only time you should ever eat there is if you're at a new job, and your boss inexplicably loves them (he smokes heavily, and thus can't taste anything) and he tells you to pick them up. Other than that, there are plenty of other delicious sub places in the area that you should go to instead of here.",1,0,0,Fred,109,85,52,13,1,3.66

Improvements needed:
- Brunch is pretty awful unless you're just planning on liquid brunch.  The prices are way too high for food that is Denny's level at best.  It seems like the brunch chef hates breakfast food and takes it out on the customers.

Neither of us usually have much use for hush puppies but we decided that may have been because we had never had Nora Lee's, because they were delicious.  The fried oysters were cooked perfectly.

Nowhere near as good as the shrimp purses we had in December. The Banh Mi took the place of the Kobe hotdog.  We miss the hot dog which was heavenly.

We ordered small plates of Gnocchi, Escargot, Seared Foie Gras, Tuna Tartar, Burrata, and Brussel Sprouts.  The Gnocchi was amazing, maybe the best thing on the menu. RJ said it was a flavor explosion in his mouth, and we were tempted to lick the bowl. He made me taste the Escargot, and the flavor was delicious, but I could just not get past the snail texture. He did not like the Foie Gras and I would not taste it. The Brussel Sprouts were cooked perfectly with a lot of crispy bacon.  I was very disappointed in the Burrata and the Tuna Tartar.  Neither came with any type of pita, or chip, or flatbread, so we had to eat off the plate.  I don't want to eat a hunk of cheese by itself, it needs to go on something.  The Burrata was missing the prosciutto, and the Tuna Tartar was just like a big blob of avocado and raw tuna.  Not good at all.  I took it home so I could eat it with on something the next day.

RJ brought me here on Saturday, Dec 17, and we sat at the bar. The bartenders are always friendly and the drinks are delicious.  We started with the spicy kani salad and shumai.  RJ always gets the hairy Mexican which is fried shrimp, avocado, spicy sauce inside, topped with crabstick + eel sauce, and I ordered the Double Fantasy which is lobster tail tempura, snow crab meat + avocado, topped with Cajun white tuna + pepper seared tuna. We asked the bartender for dessert recommendation and she suggested the chocolate egg rolls. OMG they were little pieces of fried chocolate heaven. Mikimotos never disappoints.",0,0,0,Sherry,722,590,220,175,21,3.63

We both ordered crab salad, and he had the Hairy Mexican Fried which is shrimp, avocado, spicy sauce, topped with crab stick and eel sauce, and the Spider roll which is Fried soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber, masago crab stick. I had the Chesapeake roll which was Fresh colossal jumbo lump crab, asparagus, topped with sesame seeds, and the Malay roll which was Crispy Chilean sea bass, asparagus, spicy sauce, topped with sesame seeds. They did a really great job of packing everything to go, even gave us little paper dishes for the soy sauce.  The sushi was stellar, especially the Malay roll.  Very creative and fresh. This was a great idea, and I can't wait to go back when Mikimotos is open.",0,0,0,Sherry,722,590,220,175,21,3.63

He had Sunomono which is cucumber, wakame seaweed salad, with crab, octopus, shrimp, and whitefish, I had the Mikimotos Special Crab Salad with seaweed and crab, and we shared lobster dumplings, the Spider, the Hairy Mexican, and the Chesapeake.  The lobster dumplings were really good, with large chunks of lobster and a sauce that tasted like seafood bisque.  The salads were amazing, so fresh and crisp and delicious.  The sushi was excellent as usual, and we had to ask for a box because there was so much we couldn't finish.  Service was a little slow, and we never got drink refills that we desperately needed.  It took forever to get the check and RJ needed to get back to work.  If not for the service this would be a 5.",0,0,0,Sherry,722,590,220,175,21,3.63

Not my kind of place or crowd at all.  It wasn't very crowded, and service was extremely slow even though the bar didn't have much to do.  They have advertising for $5 rum punch and margaritas that they no longer carry, and according to the bartender would not be getting any more.  So maybe take the sign down? The bar is pretty shabby, although I hear the deck is nice in the summer.  However, I don't mind if I never go back.",1,0,1,Sherry,722,590,220,175,21,3.63

It's not.  RJ ordered me a mango martini which was delicious, and we ordered the Potsticker sampler, Chicken Satay, and Shrimp Spring Rolls.  The potstickers were good, but I expected something outrageously fantastic. No one explained them so we just had to eat our way through guessing which ones were which.  The chicken satay was good but just a little dry, and the shrimp spring rolls were excellent with large pieces of shrimp and vegetables.  The dipping sauces were spicy as well as full of flavor. We had red bean ice cream for dessert which was wonderful, and a different texture then what we have had before.",0,0,0,Sherry,722,590,220,175,21,3.63
